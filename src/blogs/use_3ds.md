So, you downloaded this 3DS rom and while loading on the emulator, it shows that the rom is encrypted. What do you do?
Maybe read this for more clarity - [https://citra-emu.org/wiki/user-directory/](https://citra-emu.org/wiki/user-directory/).
If you are unable to follow or have less time, maybe read on for a solution.

You might be using an emulator like Citra or maybe something else so what are the alternatives or the solutions here:-

1. Decrypt the rom using
   [https://gbatemp.net/download/batch-cia-3ds-decryptor.35098/](https://gbatemp.net/download/batch-cia-3ds-decryptor.35098/) on
   a Windows PC.

Don't have access to a computer currently or not having Windows? Follow on...

2. Add the following AES keys to Citra AES Keys so that Citra can decrypt on the fly. Download the file from here - {{ '/cdn/aes_keys.txt' | url }}.
   Rename the file to - `aes_keys.txt`. On a linux or mac, move the file to `~/.local/share/citra-emu/sysdata/`. Restart Citra
   and see if it works.

3. Directly download unencrypted roms from -
   [https://archive.org/download/3dsdecrypted](https://archive.org/download/3dsdecrypted) and use them.
