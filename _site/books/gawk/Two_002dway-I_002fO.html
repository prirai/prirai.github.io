<p>It is often useful to be able to
send data to a separate program for
processing and then read the result.  This can always be
done with temporary files:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># Write the data for processing
tempfile = (&quot;mydata.&quot; PROCINFO[&quot;pid&quot;])
while (<var>not done with data</var>)
    print <var>data</var> | (&quot;subprogram &gt; &quot; tempfile)
close(&quot;subprogram &gt; &quot; tempfile)

# Read the results, remove tempfile when done
while ((getline newdata &lt; tempfile) &gt; 0)
    <var>process</var> newdata <var>appropriately</var>
close(tempfile)
system(&quot;rm &quot; tempfile)
</pre></div>

<p>This works, but not elegantly.  Among other things, it requires that
the program be run in a directory that cannot be shared among users;
for example, <samp>/tmp</samp> will not do, as another user might happen
to be using a temporary file with the same name.<a id="DOCF87" href="#FOOT87"><sup>87</sup></a> </p>

<span id="index-csh-utility-2"></span>
<p>However, with <code>gawk</code>, it is possible to
open a <em>two-way</em> pipe to another process.  The second process is
termed a <em>coprocess</em>, as it runs in parallel with <code>gawk</code>.
The two-way connection is created using the &lsquo;<samp>|&amp;</samp>&rsquo; operator
(borrowed from the Korn shell, <code>ksh</code>):<a id="DOCF88" href="#FOOT88"><sup>88</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">do {
    print <var>data</var> |&amp; &quot;subprogram&quot;
    &quot;subprogram&quot; |&amp; getline results
} while (<var>data left to process</var>)
close(&quot;subprogram&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>The first time an I/O operation is executed using the &lsquo;<samp>|&amp;</samp>&rsquo;
operator, <code>gawk</code> creates a two-way pipeline to a child process
that runs the other program.  Output created with <code>print</code>
or <code>printf</code> is written to the program&rsquo;s standard input, and
output from the program&rsquo;s standard output can be read by the <code>gawk</code>
program using <code>getline</code>.
As is the case with processes started by &lsquo;<samp>|</samp>&rsquo;, the subprogram
can be any program, or pipeline of programs, that can be started by
the shell.
</p>
<p>There are some cautionary items to be aware of:
</p>
<ul>
<li> As the code inside <code>gawk</code> currently stands, the coprocess&rsquo;s
standard error goes to the same place that the parent <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s
standard error goes. It is not possible to read the child&rsquo;s
standard error separately.

<span id="index-deadlocks"></span>
<span id="index-buffering-2"></span>
<span id="index-getline-command-12"></span>
</li><li> I/O buffering may be a problem.  <code>gawk</code> automatically
flushes all output down the pipe to the coprocess.
However, if the coprocess does not flush its output,
<code>gawk</code> may hang when doing a <code>getline</code> in order to read
the coprocess&rsquo;s results.  This could lead to a situation
known as <em>deadlock</em>, where each process is waiting for the
other one to do something.
</li></ul>

<span id="index-close_0028_0029-function-4"></span>
<p>It is possible to close just one end of the two-way pipe to
a coprocess, by supplying a second argument to the <code>close()</code>
function of either <code>&quot;to&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;from&quot;</code>
(see section <a href="Close-Files-And-Pipes.html">Closing Input and Output Redirections</a>).
These strings tell <code>gawk</code> to close the end of the pipe
that sends data to the coprocess or the end that reads from it,
respectively.
</p>
<span id="index-sort-utility-1"></span>
<p>This is particularly necessary in order to use
the system <code>sort</code> utility as part of a coprocess;
<code>sort</code> must read <em>all</em> of its input
data before it can produce any output.
The <code>sort</code> program does not receive an end-of-file indication
until <code>gawk</code> closes the write end of the pipe.
</p>
<p>When you have finished writing data to the <code>sort</code>
utility, you can close the <code>&quot;to&quot;</code> end of the pipe, and
then start reading sorted data via <code>getline</code>.
For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">BEGIN {
    command = &quot;LC_ALL=C sort&quot;
    n = split(&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;, a, &quot;&quot;)

    for (i = n; i &gt; 0; i--)
        print a[i] |&amp; command
    close(command, &quot;to&quot;)

    while ((command |&amp; getline line) &gt; 0)
        print &quot;got&quot;, line
    close(command)
}
</pre></div>

<p>This program writes the letters of the alphabet in reverse order, one
per line, down the two-way pipe to <code>sort</code>.  It then closes the
write end of the pipe, so that <code>sort</code> receives an end-of-file
indication.  This causes <code>sort</code> to sort the data and write the
sorted data back to the <code>gawk</code> program.  Once all of the data
has been read, <code>gawk</code> terminates the coprocess and exits.
</p>
<span id="index-ASCII-5"></span>
<p>As a side note, the assignment &lsquo;<samp>LC_ALL=C</samp>&rsquo; in the <code>sort</code>
command ensures traditional Unix (ASCII) sorting from <code>sort</code>.
This is not strictly necessary here, but it&rsquo;s good to know how to do this.
</p>
<p>Be careful when closing the <code>&quot;from&quot;</code> end of a two-way pipe; in this
case <code>gawk</code> waits for the child process to exit, which may cause
your program to hang.  (Thus, this particular feature is of much less
use in practice than being able to close the <code>&quot;to&quot;</code> end.)
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>CAUTION:</b> Normally,
it is a fatal error to write to the <code>&quot;to&quot;</code> end of a two-way
pipe which has been closed, and it is also a fatal error to read
from the <code>&quot;from&quot;</code> end of a two-way pipe that has been closed.
</p>
<p>You may set <code>PROCINFO[&quot;<var>command</var>&quot;, &quot;NONFATAL&quot;]</code> to
make such operations become nonfatal. If you do so, you then need
to check <code>ERRNO</code> after each <code>print</code>, <code>printf</code>,
or <code>getline</code>.
See section <a href="Nonfatal.html">Enabling Nonfatal Output</a>, for more information.
</p></blockquote>

<span id="index-gawk-61"></span>
<span id="index-PROCINFO-array-8"></span>
<p>You may also use pseudo-ttys (ptys) for
two-way communication instead of pipes, if your system supports them.
This is done on a per-command basis, by setting a special element
in the <code>PROCINFO</code> array
(see section <a href="Auto_002dset.html">Built-in Variables That Convey Information</a>),
like so:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">command = &quot;sort -nr&quot;           # command, save in convenience variable
PROCINFO[command, &quot;pty&quot;] = 1   # update PROCINFO
print &hellip; |&amp; command           # start two-way pipe
&hellip;
</pre></div>

<p>If your system does not have ptys, or if all the system&rsquo;s ptys are in use,
<code>gawk</code> automatically falls back to using regular pipes.
</p>
<p>Using ptys usually avoids the buffer deadlock issues described earlier,
at some loss in performance. This is because the tty driver buffers
and sends data line-by-line.  On systems with the <code>stdbuf</code>
(part of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html">GNU Coreutils package</a>), you can use that program instead of ptys.
</p>
<p>Note also that ptys are not fully transparent. Certain binary control
codes, such <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> for end-of-file, are interpreted by the tty
driver and not passed through.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>CAUTION:</b> Finally, coprocesses open up the possibility of <em>deadlock</em> between
<code>gawk</code> and the program running in the coprocess. This can occur
if you send &ldquo;too much&rdquo; data to the coprocess before reading any back;
each process is blocked writing data with no one available to read what
they&rsquo;ve already written.  There is no workaround for deadlock; careful
programming and knowledge of the behavior of the coprocess are required.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The following example, due to Andrew Schorr, demonstrates how
using ptys can help deal with buffering deadlocks.
</p>
<p>Suppose <code>gawk</code> were unable to add numbers.
You could use a coprocess to do it. Here&rsquo;s an exceedingly
simple program written for that purpose: 
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>cat add.c</kbd>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 

int 
main(void) 
{ 
    int x, y; 
    while (scanf(&quot;%d %d&quot;, &amp; x, &amp; y) == 2) 
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, x + y); 
    return 0; 
} 
$ <kbd>cc -O add.c -o add</kbd>	<i>Compile the program</i>
</pre></div>

<p>You could then write an exceedingly simple <code>gawk</code> program
to add numbers by passing them to the coprocess:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>echo 1 2 |</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>gawk -v cmd=./add '{ print |&amp; cmd; cmd |&amp; getline x; print x }'</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>And it would deadlock, because <samp>add.c</samp> fails to call
&lsquo;<samp>setlinebuf(stdout)</samp>&rsquo;. The <code>add</code> program freezes. 
</p>
<p>Now try instead: 
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>echo 1 2 |</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>gawk -v cmd=add 'BEGIN { PROCINFO[cmd, &quot;pty&quot;] = 1 }</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>                 { print |&amp; cmd; cmd |&amp; getline x; print x }'</kbd>
-| 3 
</pre></div>

<p>By using a pty, <code>gawk</code> fools the standard I/O library into
thinking it has an interactive session, so it defaults to line buffering.
And now, magically, it works!

<h5><a id="FOOT87" href="#DOCF87">(87)</a></h3>
<p>Michael
Brennan suggests the use of <code>rand()</code> to generate unique
file names. This is a valid point; nevertheless, temporary files
remain more difficult to use than two-way pipes.</p>
<h5><a id="FOOT88" href="#DOCF88">(88)</a></h3>
<p>This is very
different from the same operator in the C shell and in Bash.</p>
