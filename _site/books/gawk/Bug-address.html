<span id="Submitting-Bug-Reports"></span><h4 class="appendixsubsec">B.4.1 Submitting Bug Reports</h4>

<p>Before reporting a bug, make sure you have really found a genuine bug.
First, verify that you have the latest version of <code>gawk</code>.
Many bugs (usually subtle ones) are fixed at each release, and if yours
is out of date, the problem may already have been solved.
</p>
<p>Second, please see if setting the environment variable <code>LC_ALL</code>
to <code>LC_ALL=C</code> causes things to behave as you expect. If so, it&rsquo;s
a locale issue, and may or may not really be a bug.
</p>
<p>Third, carefully reread the documentation and see if it says you can do
what you&rsquo;re trying to do.  If it&rsquo;s not clear whether you should be able
to do something or not, report that too; it&rsquo;s a bug in the documentation!
</p>
<p>Finally, before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it
to the smallest possible <code>awk</code> program and input data file that
reproduce the problem.  Then send us the program and data file,
some idea of what kind of Unix system you&rsquo;re using,
the compiler you used to compile <code>gawk</code>, and the exact results
<code>gawk</code> gave you.  Also say what you expected to occur; this helps
us decide whether the problem is really in the documentation.
</p>
<p>Make sure to include the version number of <code>gawk</code> you are using.
You can get this information with the command &lsquo;<samp>gawk --version</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<span id="index-bug_002dgawk_0040gnu_002eorg-bug-reporting-address"></span>
<span id="index-email-address-for-bug-reports_002c-bug_002dgawk_0040gnu_002eorg"></span>
<span id="index-bug-reports_002c-email-address_002c-bug_002dgawk_0040gnu_002eorg"></span>
<p>Once you have a precise problem description, send email to
&ldquo;bug-gawk at gnu dot org&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The <code>gawk</code> maintainers subscribe to this address, and
thus they will receive your bug report.
Although you can send mail to the maintainers directly,
the bug reporting address is preferred because the
email list is archived at the GNU Project.
<em>All email must be in English. This is the only language
understood in common by all the maintainers.</em>
In addition, please be sure to send all mail in <em>plain text</em>,
not (or not exclusively) in HTML.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Many distributions of GNU/Linux and the various BSD-based operating systems
have their own bug reporting systems.  If you report a bug using your distribution&rsquo;s
bug reporting system, you should also send a copy to
&ldquo;bug-gawk at gnu dot org&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>This is for two reasons.  First, although some distributions forward
bug reports &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; to the GNU mailing list, many don&rsquo;t, so there is a good
chance that the <code>gawk</code>  maintainers won&rsquo;t even see the bug report!  Second,
mail to the GNU list is archived, and having everything at the GNU Project
keeps things self-contained and not dependent on other organizations.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Non-bug suggestions are always welcome as well.  If you have questions
about things that are unclear in the documentation or are just obscure
features, ask on the bug list; we will try to help you out if we can.
</p>
<p>Please note: We ask that you follow the
<a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html">GNU Kind Communication Guidelines</a> in your correspondence on the
list (as well as off of it).
