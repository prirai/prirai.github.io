<span id="Profiling-Your-awk-Programs"></span><h3 class="section">12.5 Profiling Your <code>awk</code> Programs</h3>
<span id="index-awk-programs-21"></span>
<span id="index-profiling-awk-programs"></span>
<span id="index-awkprof_002eout-file"></span>
<span id="index-files-27"></span>

<p>You may produce execution traces of your <code>awk</code> programs.
This is done by passing the option <samp>--profile</samp> to <code>gawk</code>.
When <code>gawk</code> has finished running, it creates a profile of your program in a file
named <samp>awkprof.out</samp>. Because it is profiling, it also executes up to 45% slower than
<code>gawk</code> normally does.
</p>
<span id="index-_002d_002dprofile-option-1"></span>
<p>As shown in the following example,
the <samp>--profile</samp> option can be used to change the name of the file
where <code>gawk</code> will write the profile:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">gawk --profile=myprog.prof -f myprog.awk data1 data2
</pre></div>

<p>In the preceding example, <code>gawk</code> places the profile in
<samp>myprog.prof</samp> instead of in <samp>awkprof.out</samp>.
</p>
<p>Here is a sample session showing a simple <code>awk</code> program,
its input data, and the results from running <code>gawk</code> with the
<samp>--profile</samp> option.  First, the <code>awk</code> program:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">BEGIN { print &quot;First BEGIN rule&quot; }

END { print &quot;First END rule&quot; }

/foo/ {
    print &quot;matched /foo/, gosh&quot;
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++)
        sing()
}

{
    if (/foo/)
        print &quot;if is true&quot;
    else
        print &quot;else is true&quot;
}

BEGIN { print &quot;Second BEGIN rule&quot; }

END { print &quot;Second END rule&quot; }

function sing(    dummy)
{
    print &quot;I gotta be me!&quot;
}
</pre></div>

<p>Following is the input data:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">foo
bar
baz
foo
junk
</pre></div>

<p>Here is the <samp>awkprof.out</samp> that results from running the
<code>gawk</code> profiler on this program and data (this example also
illustrates that <code>awk</code> programmers sometimes get up very early
in the morning to work):
</p>
<span id="index-BEGIN-pattern-15"></span>
<span id="index-END-pattern-9"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    # gawk profile, created Mon Sep 29 05:16:21 2014

    # BEGIN rule(s)

    BEGIN {
 1          print &quot;First BEGIN rule&quot;
    }

    BEGIN {
 1          print &quot;Second BEGIN rule&quot;
    }

    # Rule(s)

 5  /foo/ { # 2
 2          print &quot;matched /foo/, gosh&quot;
 6          for (i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++) {
 6                  sing()
            }
    }

 5  {
 5          if (/foo/) { # 2
 2                  print &quot;if is true&quot;
 3          } else {
 3                  print &quot;else is true&quot;
            }
    }

    # END rule(s)

    END {
 1          print &quot;First END rule&quot;
    }

    END {
 1          print &quot;Second END rule&quot;
    }


    # Functions, listed alphabetically

 6  function sing(dummy)
    {
 6          print &quot;I gotta be me!&quot;
    }
</pre></div>

<p>This example illustrates many of the basic features of profiling output.
They are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The program is printed in the order <code>BEGIN</code> rules,
<code>BEGINFILE</code> rules,
pattern&ndash;action rules,
<code>ENDFILE</code> rules, <code>END</code> rules, and functions, listed
alphabetically.
Multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules retain their
separate identities, as do
multiple <code>BEGINFILE</code> and <code>ENDFILE</code> rules.

<span id="index-patterns-11"></span>
</li><li> Pattern&ndash;action rules have two counts.
The first count, to the left of the rule, shows how many times
the rule&rsquo;s pattern was <em>tested</em>.
The second count, to the right of the rule&rsquo;s opening left brace
in a comment,
shows how many times the rule&rsquo;s action was <em>executed</em>.
The difference between the two indicates how many times the rule&rsquo;s
pattern evaluated to false.

</li><li> Similarly,
the count for an <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> statement shows how many times
the condition was tested.
To the right of the opening left brace for the <code>if</code>&rsquo;s body
is a count showing how many times the condition was true.
The count for the <code>else</code>
indicates how many times the test failed.

<span id="index-loops-8"></span>
</li><li> The count for a loop header (such as <code>for</code>
or <code>while</code>) shows how many times the loop test was executed.
(Because of this, you can&rsquo;t just look at the count on the first
statement in a rule to determine how many times the rule was executed.
If the first statement is a loop, the count is misleading.)

<span id="index-functions-28"></span>
<span id="index-user_002ddefined-33"></span>
</li><li> For user-defined functions, the count next to the <code>function</code>
keyword indicates how many times the function was called.
The counts next to the statements in the body show how many times
those statements were executed.

</li><li> <span id="index-_007b_007d-_0028braces_0029-3"></span>
<span id="index-braces-_0028_007b_007d_0029-3"></span>
The layout uses &ldquo;K&amp;R&rdquo; style with TABs.
Braces are used everywhere, even when
the body of an <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, or loop is only a single statement.

<span id="index-_0028_0029-_0028parentheses_0029-1"></span>
<span id="index-parentheses-_0028_0029-1"></span>
</li><li> Parentheses are used only where needed, as indicated by the structure
of the program and the precedence rules.
For example, &lsquo;<samp>(3 + 5) * 4</samp>&rsquo; means add three and five, then multiply
the total by four.  However, &lsquo;<samp>3 + 5 * 4</samp>&rsquo; has no parentheses, and
means &lsquo;<samp>3 + (5 * 4)</samp>&rsquo;.
However, explicit parentheses in the source program are retained.


</li><li> Parentheses are used around the arguments to <code>print</code>
and <code>printf</code> only when
the <code>print</code> or <code>printf</code> statement is followed by a redirection.
Similarly, if
the target of a redirection isn&rsquo;t a scalar, it gets parenthesized.

</li><li> <code>gawk</code> supplies leading comments in
front of the <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules,
the <code>BEGINFILE</code> and <code>ENDFILE</code> rules,
the pattern&ndash;action rules, and the functions.

</li></ul>

<p>The profiled version of your program may not look exactly like what you
typed when you wrote it.  This is because <code>gawk</code> creates the
profiled version by &ldquo;pretty-printing&rdquo; its internal representation of
the program.  The advantage to this is that <code>gawk</code> can produce
a standard representation.
Also, things such as:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/foo/
</pre></div>

<p>come out as:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/foo/   {
    print
}
</pre></div>

<p>which is correct, but possibly unexpected.
(If a program uses both &lsquo;<samp>print $0</samp>&rsquo; and plain
&lsquo;<samp>print</samp>&rsquo;, that distinction is retained.)
</p>
<span id="index-profiling-awk-programs-1"></span>
<span id="index-gawk-63"></span>
<span id="index-gawk-64"></span>
<span id="index-dynamic-profiling"></span>
<p>Besides creating profiles when a program has completed,
<code>gawk</code> can produce a profile while it is running.
This is useful if your <code>awk</code> program goes into an
infinite loop and you want to see what has been executed.
To use this feature, run <code>gawk</code> with the <samp>--profile</samp>
option in the background:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>gawk --profile -f myprog &amp;</kbd>
[1] 13992
</pre></div>

<span id="index-kill-command_002c-dynamic-profiling"></span>
<span id="index-USR1-signal_002c-for-dynamic-profiling"></span>
<span id="index-SIGUSR1-signal_002c-for-dynamic-profiling"></span>
<span id="index-signals"></span>
<p>The shell prints a job number and process ID number; in this case, 13992.
Use the <code>kill</code> command to send the <code>USR1</code> signal
to <code>gawk</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>kill -USR1 13992</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>As usual, the profiled version of the program is written to
<samp>awkprof.out</samp>, or to a different file if one was specified with
the <samp>--profile</samp> option.
</p>
<p>Along with the regular profile, as shown earlier, the profile file
includes a trace of any active functions:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># Function Call Stack:

#   3. baz
#   2. bar
#   1. foo
# -- main --
</pre></div>

<p>You may send <code>gawk</code> the <code>USR1</code> signal as many times as you like.
Each time, the profile and function call trace are appended to the output
profile file.
</p>
<span id="index-HUP-signal_002c-for-dynamic-profiling"></span>
<span id="index-SIGHUP-signal_002c-for-dynamic-profiling"></span>
<span id="index-signals-1"></span>
<p>If you use the <code>HUP</code> signal instead of the <code>USR1</code> signal,
<code>gawk</code> produces the profile and the function call trace and then exits.
</p>
<span id="index-INT-signal-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029"></span>
<span id="index-SIGINT-signal-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029"></span>
<span id="index-signals-2"></span>
<span id="index-QUIT-signal-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029"></span>
<span id="index-SIGQUIT-signal-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029"></span>
<span id="index-signals-3"></span>
<p>When <code>gawk</code> runs on MS-Windows systems, it uses the
<code>INT</code> and <code>QUIT</code> signals for producing the profile, and in
the case of the <code>INT</code> signal, <code>gawk</code> exits.  This is
because these systems don&rsquo;t support the <code>kill</code> command, so the
only signals you can deliver to a program are those generated by the
keyboard.  The <code>INT</code> signal is generated by the
<kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl-BREAK</kbd> key, while the
<code>QUIT</code> signal is generated by the <kbd>Ctrl-\</kbd> key.
</p>
<span id="index-pretty-printing-1"></span>
<p>Finally, <code>gawk</code> also accepts another option, <samp>--pretty-print</samp>.
When called this way, <code>gawk</code> &ldquo;pretty-prints&rdquo; the program into
<samp>awkprof.out</samp>, without any execution counts.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Once upon a time, the <samp>--pretty-print</samp> option would also run
your program.  This is no longer the case.
</p></blockquote>

<span id="index-profiling_002c-pretty-printing_002c-difference-with"></span>
<span id="index-pretty-printing-2"></span>
<p>There is a significant difference between the output created when
profiling, and that created when pretty-printing.  Pretty-printed output
preserves the original comments that were in the program, although their
placement may not correspond exactly to their original locations in the
source code. However, no comments should be lost.
Also, <code>gawk</code> does the best it can to preserve
the distinction between comments at the end of a statement and comments
on lines by themselves. This isn&rsquo;t always perfect, though.
</p>
<p>However, as a deliberate design decision, profiling output <em>omits</em>
the original program&rsquo;s comments. This allows you to focus on the
execution count data and helps you avoid the temptation to use the
profiler for pretty-printing.
</p>
<p>Additionally, pretty-printed output does not have the leading indentation
that the profiling output does. This makes it easy to pretty-print your
code once development is completed, and then use the result as the final
version of your program.
</p>
<p>Because the internal representation of your program is formatted to
recreate an <code>awk</code> program, profiling and pretty-printing
automatically disable <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s default optimizations.
</p>
<p>Profiling and pretty-printing also preserve the original format of numeric
constants; if you used an octal or hexadecimal value in your source
code, it will appear that way in the output.
