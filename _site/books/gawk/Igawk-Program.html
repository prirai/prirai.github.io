<span id="An-Easy-Way-to-Use-Library-Functions"></span><h4 class="subsection">11.3.9 An Easy Way to Use Library Functions</h4>

<span id="index-libraries-of-awk-functions-11"></span>
<span id="index-functions-27"></span>
<p>In <a href="Include-Files.html">Including Other Files into Your Program</a>, we saw how <code>gawk</code> provides a built-in
file-inclusion capability.  However, this is a <code>gawk</code> extension.
This section provides the motivation for making file inclusion
available for standard <code>awk</code>, and shows how to do it using a
combination of shell and <code>awk</code> programming.
</p>
<p>Using library functions in <code>awk</code> can be very beneficial. It
encourages code reuse and the writing of general functions. Programs are
smaller and therefore clearer.
However, using library functions is only easy when writing <code>awk</code>
programs; it is painful when running them, requiring multiple <samp>-f</samp>
options.  If <code>gawk</code> is unavailable, then so too is the <code>AWKPATH</code>
environment variable and the ability to put <code>awk</code> functions into a
library directory (see section <a href="Options.html">Command-Line Options</a>).
It would be nice to be able to write programs in the following manner:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># library functions
@include getopt.awk
@include join.awk
&hellip;

# main program
BEGIN {
    while ((c = getopt(ARGC, ARGV, &quot;a:b:cde&quot;)) != -1)
        &hellip;
    &hellip;
}
</pre></div>

<p>The following program, <samp>igawk.sh</samp>, provides this service.
It simulates <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s searching of the <code>AWKPATH</code> variable
and also allows <em>nested</em> includes (i.e., a file that is included
with <code>@include</code> can contain further <code>@include</code> statements).
<code>igawk</code> makes an effort to only include files once, so that nested
includes don&rsquo;t accidentally include a library function twice.
</p>
<p><code>igawk</code> should behave just like <code>gawk</code> externally.  This
means it should accept all of <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s command-line arguments,
including the ability to have multiple source files specified via
<samp>-f</samp> and the ability to mix command-line and library source files.
</p>
<p>The program is written using the POSIX Shell (<code>sh</code>) command
language.<a id="DOCF81" href="#FOOT81"><sup>81</sup></a> It works as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Loop through the arguments, saving anything that doesn&rsquo;t represent
<code>awk</code> source code for later, when the expanded program is run.

</li><li> For any arguments that do represent <code>awk</code> text, put the arguments into
a shell variable that will be expanded.  There are two cases:

<ol type="a" start="1">
<li> Literal text, provided with <samp>-e</samp> or <samp>--source</samp>.  This
text is just appended directly.

</li><li> Source file names, provided with <samp>-f</samp>.  We use a neat trick and
append &lsquo;<samp>@include <var>filename</var></samp>&rsquo; to the shell variable&rsquo;s contents.
Because the file-inclusion program works the way <code>gawk</code> does, this
gets the text of the file included in the program at the correct point.
</li></ol>

</li><li> Run an <code>awk</code> program (naturally) over the shell variable&rsquo;s contents to expand
<code>@include</code> statements.  The expanded program is placed in a second
shell variable.

</li><li> Run the expanded program with <code>gawk</code> and any other original command-line
arguments that the user supplied (such as the data file names).
</li></ol>

<p>This program uses shell variables extensively: for storing command-line arguments and
the text of the <code>awk</code> program that will expand the user&rsquo;s program, for the
user&rsquo;s original program, and for the expanded program.  Doing so removes some
potential problems that might arise were we to use temporary files instead,
at the cost of making the script somewhat more complicated.
</p>
<p>The initial part of the program turns on shell tracing if the first
argument is &lsquo;<samp>debug</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The next part loops through all the command-line arguments.
There are several cases of interest:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>--</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This ends the arguments to <code>igawk</code>.  Anything else should be passed on
to the user&rsquo;s <code>awk</code> program without being evaluated.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>-W</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This indicates that the next option is specific to <code>gawk</code>.  To make
argument processing easier, the <samp>-W</samp> is appended to the front of the
remaining arguments and the loop continues.  (This is an <code>sh</code>
programming trick.  Don&rsquo;t worry about it if you are not familiar with
<code>sh</code>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>-v</samp>, <samp>-F</samp></dt>
<dd><p>These are saved and passed on to <code>gawk</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>-f</samp>, <samp>--file</samp>, <samp>--file=</samp>, <samp>-Wfile=</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The file name is appended to the shell variable <code>program</code> with an
<code>@include</code> statement.
The <code>expr</code> utility is used to remove the leading option part of the
argument (e.g., &lsquo;<samp>--file=</samp>&rsquo;).
(Typical <code>sh</code> usage would be to use the <code>echo</code> and <code>sed</code>
utilities to do this work.  Unfortunately, some versions of <code>echo</code> evaluate
escape sequences in their arguments, possibly mangling the program text.
Using <code>expr</code> avoids this problem.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>--source</samp>, <samp>--source=</samp>, <samp>-Wsource=</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The source text is appended to <code>program</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>--version</samp>, <samp>-Wversion</samp></dt>
<dd><p><code>igawk</code> prints its version number, runs &lsquo;<samp>gawk --version</samp>&rsquo;
to get the <code>gawk</code> version information, and then exits.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If none of the <samp>-f</samp>, <samp>--file</samp>, <samp>-Wfile</samp>, <samp>--source</samp>,
or <samp>-Wsource</samp> arguments are supplied, then the first nonoption argument
should be the <code>awk</code> program.  If there are no command-line
arguments left, <code>igawk</code> prints an error message and exits.
Otherwise, the first argument is appended to <code>program</code>.
In any case, after the arguments have been processed,
the shell variable
<code>program</code> contains the complete text of the original <code>awk</code>
program.
</p>
<p>The program is as follows:
</p>
<span id="index-igawk_002esh-program"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#! /bin/sh
# igawk --- like gawk but do @include processing

# At this point, `program' has the program.
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>awk</code> program to process <code>@include</code> directives
is stored in the shell variable <code>expand_prog</code>.  Doing this keeps
the shell script readable.  The <code>awk</code> program
reads through the user&rsquo;s program, one line at a time, using <code>getline</code>
(see section <a href="Getline.html">Explicit Input with <code>getline</code></a>).  The input
file names and <code>@include</code> statements are managed using a stack.
As each <code>@include</code> is encountered, the current file name is
&ldquo;pushed&rdquo; onto the stack and the file named in the <code>@include</code>
directive becomes the current file name.  As each file is finished,
the stack is &ldquo;popped,&rdquo; and the previous input file becomes the current
input file again.  The process is started by making the original file
the first one on the stack.
</p>
<p>The <code>pathto()</code> function does the work of finding the full path to
a file.  It simulates <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s behavior when searching the
<code>AWKPATH</code> environment variable
(see section <a href="AWKPATH-Variable.html">The <code>AWKPATH</code> Environment Variable</a>).
If a file name has a &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo; in it, no path search is done.
Similarly, if the file name is <code>&quot;-&quot;</code>, then that string is
used as-is.  Otherwise,
the file name is concatenated with the name of each directory in
the path, and an attempt is made to open the generated file name.
The only way to test if a file can be read in <code>awk</code> is to go
ahead and try to read it with <code>getline</code>; this is what <code>pathto()</code>
does.<a id="DOCF82" href="#FOOT82"><sup>82</sup></a>
If the file can be read, it is closed and the file name
is returned:
</p>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">expand_prog='

function pathto(file,    i, t, junk)
{
    if (index(file, &quot;/&quot;) != 0)
        return file

    if (file == &quot;-&quot;)
        return file

    for (i = 1; i &lt;= ndirs; i++) {
        t = (pathlist[i] &quot;/&quot; file)
</pre><pre class="example">        if ((getline junk &lt; t) &gt; 0) {
            # found it
            close(t)
            return t
        }
</pre><pre class="example">    }
    return &quot;&quot;
}
</pre></div>

<p>The main program is contained inside one <code>BEGIN</code> rule.  The first thing it
does is set up the <code>pathlist</code> array that <code>pathto()</code> uses.  After
splitting the path on &lsquo;<samp>:</samp>&rsquo;, null elements are replaced with <code>&quot;.&quot;</code>,
which represents the current directory:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">BEGIN {
    path = ENVIRON[&quot;AWKPATH&quot;]
    ndirs = split(path, pathlist, &quot;:&quot;)
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= ndirs; i++) {
        if (pathlist[i] == &quot;&quot;)
            pathlist[i] = &quot;.&quot;
    }
</pre></div>

<p>The stack is initialized with <code>ARGV[1]</code>, which will be <code>&quot;/dev/stdin&quot;</code>.
The main loop comes next.  Input lines are read in succession. Lines that
do not start with <code>@include</code> are printed verbatim.
If the line does start with <code>@include</code>, the file name is in <code>$2</code>.
<code>pathto()</code> is called to generate the full path.  If it cannot, then the program
prints an error message and continues.
</p>
<p>The next thing to check is if the file is included already.  The
<code>processed</code> array is indexed by the full file name of each included
file and it tracks this information for us.  If the file is
seen again, a warning message is printed. Otherwise, the new file name is
pushed onto the stack and processing continues.
</p>
<p>Finally, when <code>getline</code> encounters the end of the input file, the file
is closed and the stack is popped.  When <code>stackptr</code> is less than zero,
the program is done:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    stackptr = 0
    input[stackptr] = ARGV[1] # ARGV[1] is first file

    for (; stackptr &gt;= 0; stackptr--) {
        while ((getline &lt; input[stackptr]) &gt; 0) {
            if (tolower($1) != &quot;@include&quot;) {
                print
                continue
            }
            fpath = pathto($2)
            if (fpath == &quot;&quot;) {
                printf(&quot;igawk: %s:%d: cannot find %s\n&quot;,
                    input[stackptr], FNR, $2) &gt; &quot;/dev/stderr&quot;
                continue
            }
            if (! (fpath in processed)) {
                processed[fpath] = input[stackptr]
                input[++stackptr] = fpath  # push onto stack
            } else
                print $2, &quot;included in&quot;, input[stackptr],
                    &quot;already included in&quot;,
                    processed[fpath] &gt; &quot;/dev/stderr&quot;
        }
        close(input[stackptr])
    }
}'  # close quote ends `expand_prog' variable

processed_program=$(gawk -- &quot;$expand_prog&quot; /dev/stdin &lt;&lt; EOF
$program
EOF
)
</pre></div>

<p>The shell construct &lsquo;<samp><var>command</var> &lt;&lt; <var>marker</var></samp>&rsquo; is called
a <em>here document</em>.  Everything in the shell script up to the
<var>marker</var> is fed to <var>command</var> as input.  The shell processes
the contents of the here document for variable and command substitution
(and possibly other things as well, depending upon the shell).
</p>
<p>The shell construct &lsquo;<samp>$(&hellip;)</samp>&rsquo; is called <em>command substitution</em>.
The output of the command inside the parentheses is substituted
into the command line.
Because the result is used in a variable assignment,
it is saved as a single string, even if the results contain whitespace.
</p>
<p>The expanded program is saved in the variable <code>processed_program</code>.
It&rsquo;s done in these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Run <code>gawk</code> with the <code>@include</code>-processing program (the
value of the <code>expand_prog</code> shell variable) reading standard input.

</li><li> Standard input is the contents of the user&rsquo;s program,
from the shell variable <code>program</code>.
Feed its contents to <code>gawk</code> via a here document.

</li><li> Save the results of this processing in the shell variable
<code>processed_program</code> by using command substitution.
</li></ol>

<p>The last step is to call <code>gawk</code> with the expanded program,
along with the original
options and command-line arguments that the user supplied:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">eval gawk $opts -- '&quot;$processed_program&quot;' '&quot;$@&quot;'
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>eval</code> command is a shell construct that reruns the shell&rsquo;s parsing
process.  This keeps things properly quoted.
</p>
<p>This version of <code>igawk</code> represents the fifth version of this program.
There are four key simplifications that make the program work better:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Using <code>@include</code> even for the files named with <samp>-f</samp> makes building
the initial collected <code>awk</code> program much simpler; all the
<code>@include</code> processing can be done once.

</li><li> Not trying to save the line read with <code>getline</code>
in the <code>pathto()</code> function when testing for the
file&rsquo;s accessibility for use with the main program simplifies things
considerably.

</li><li> Using a <code>getline</code> loop in the <code>BEGIN</code> rule does it all in one
place.  It is not necessary to call out to a separate loop for processing
nested <code>@include</code> statements.

</li><li> Instead of saving the expanded program in a temporary file, putting it in a shell variable
avoids some potential security problems.
This has the disadvantage that the script relies upon more features
of the <code>sh</code> language, making it harder to follow for those who
aren&rsquo;t familiar with <code>sh</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>Also, this program illustrates that it is often worthwhile to combine
<code>sh</code> and <code>awk</code> programming together.  You can usually
accomplish quite a lot, without having to resort to low-level programming
in C or C++, and it is frequently easier to do certain kinds of string
and argument manipulation using the shell than it is in <code>awk</code>.
</p>
<p>Finally, <code>igawk</code> shows that it is not always necessary to add new
features to a program; they can often be layered on top.<a id="DOCF83" href="#FOOT83"><sup>83</sup></a>
