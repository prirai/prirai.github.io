<span id="Goals-For-A-New-Mechanism"></span><h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.5.2 Goals For A New Mechanism</h4>

<p>Some goals for the new API were:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The API should be independent of <code>gawk</code> internals.  Changes in
<code>gawk</code> internals should not be visible to the writer of an
extension function.

</li><li> The API should provide <em>binary</em> compatibility across <code>gawk</code>
releases as long as the API itself does not change.

</li><li> The API should enable extensions written in C or C++ to have roughly the
same &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; to <code>awk</code>-level code as <code>awk</code>
functions do. This means that extensions should have:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- The ability to access function parameters.

</li><li>- The ability to turn an undefined parameter into an array (call by reference).

</li><li>- The ability to create, access and update global variables.

</li><li>- Easy access to all the elements of an array at once (&ldquo;array flattening&rdquo;)
in order to loop over all the element in an easy fashion for C code.

</li><li>- The ability to create arrays (including <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s true
arrays of arrays).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>Some additional important goals were:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The API should use only features in ISO C 90, so that extensions
can be written using the widest range of C and C++ compilers. The header
should include the appropriate &lsquo;<samp>#ifdef __cplusplus</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>extern &quot;C&quot;</samp>&rsquo;
magic so that a C++ compiler could be used.  (If using C++, the runtime
system has to be smart enough to call any constructors and destructors,
as <code>gawk</code> is a C program. As of this writing, this has not been
tested.)

</li><li> The API mechanism should not require access to <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s
symbols<a id="DOCF122" href="#FOOT122"><sup>122</sup></a> by the compile-time or dynamic linker,
in order to enable creation of extensions that also work on MS-Windows.
</li></ul>

<p>During development, it became clear that there were other features
that should be available to extensions, which were also subsequently
provided:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Extensions should have the ability to hook into <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s
I/O redirection mechanism.  In particular, the <code>xgawk</code>
developers provided a so-called &ldquo;open hook&rdquo; to take over reading
records.  During development, this was generalized to allow
extensions to hook into input processing, output processing, and
two-way I/O.

</li><li> An extension should be able to provide a &ldquo;call back&rdquo; function
to perform cleanup actions when <code>gawk</code> exits.

</li><li> An extension should be able to provide a version string so that
<code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s <samp>--version</samp> option can provide information
about extensions as well.
</li></ul>

<p>The requirement to avoid access to <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s symbols is, at first
glance, a difficult one to meet.
</p>
<p>One design, apparently used by Perl and Ruby and maybe others, would
be to make the mainline <code>gawk</code> code into a library, with the
<code>gawk</code> utility a small C <code>main()</code> function linked against
the library.
</p>
<p>This seemed like the tail wagging the dog, complicating build and
installation and making a simple copy of the <code>gawk</code> executable
from one system to another (or one place to another on the same
system!) into a chancy operation.
</p>
<p>Pat Rankin suggested the solution that was adopted.
See section <a href="Extension-Mechanism-Outline.html">How It Works at a High Level</a>, for the details.

<h5><a id="FOOT122" href="#DOCF122">(122)</a></h3>
<p>The <em>symbols</em> are the variables and functions
defined inside <code>gawk</code>.  Access to these symbols by code
external to <code>gawk</code> loaded dynamically at runtime is
problematic on MS-Windows.</p>
