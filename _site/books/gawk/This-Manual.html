<p>The term <code>awk</code> refers to a particular program as well as to the language you
use to tell this program what to do.  When we need to be careful, we call
the language &ldquo;the <code>awk</code> language,&rdquo;
and the program &ldquo;the <code>awk</code> utility.&rdquo;
This Web page explains
both how to write programs in the <code>awk</code> language and how to
run the <code>awk</code> utility.
The term &ldquo;<code>awk</code> program&rdquo; refers to a program written by you in
the <code>awk</code> programming language.
</p>
<span id="index-gawk-3"></span>
<span id="index-awk-8"></span>
<span id="index-POSIX-awk"></span>
<p>Primarily, this Web page explains the features of <code>awk</code>
as defined in the POSIX standard.  It does so in the context of the
<code>gawk</code> implementation.  While doing so, it also
attempts to describe important differences between <code>gawk</code>
and other <code>awk</code>
implementations.<a id="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Finally, it notes any <code>gawk</code> features that are not in
the POSIX standard for <code>awk</code>.
</p>
<p>This Web page has the difficult task of being both a tutorial and a reference.
If you are a novice, feel free to skip over details that seem too complex.
You should also ignore the many cross-references; they are for the
expert user and for the Info and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/">HTML</a>
versions of the Web page.
</p>
<p>There are sidebars
scattered throughout the Web page.
They add a more complete explanation of points that are relevant, but not likely
to be of interest on first reading.
All appear in the index, under the heading &ldquo;sidebar.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Most of the time, the examples use complete <code>awk</code> programs.
Some of the more advanced sections show only the part of the <code>awk</code>
program that illustrates the concept being described.
</p>
<p>Although this Web page is aimed principally at people who have not been
exposed
to <code>awk</code>, there is a lot of information here that even the <code>awk</code>
expert should find useful.  In particular, the description of POSIX
<code>awk</code> and the example programs in
<a href="Library-Functions.html">A Library of <code>awk</code> Functions</a>, and
in
<a href="Sample-Programs.html">Practical <code>awk</code> Programs</a>,
should be of interest.
</p>
<p>This Web page is split into several parts, as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Part I describes the <code>awk</code> language and the <code>gawk</code> program in detail.
It starts with the basics, and continues through all of the features of <code>awk</code>.
It contains the following chapters:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- <a href="Getting-Started.html">Getting Started with <code>awk</code></a>,
provides the essentials you need to know to begin using <code>awk</code>.

</li><li>- <a href="Invoking-Gawk.html">Running <code>awk</code> and <code>gawk</code></a>,
describes how to run <code>gawk</code>, the meaning of its
command-line options, and how it finds <code>awk</code>
program source files.

</li><li>- <a href="Regexp.html">Regular Expressions</a>,
introduces regular expressions in general, and in particular the flavors
supported by POSIX <code>awk</code> and <code>gawk</code>.

</li><li>- <a href="Reading-Files.html">Reading Input Files</a>,
describes how <code>awk</code> reads your data.
It introduces the concepts of records and fields, as well
as the <code>getline</code> command.
I/O redirection is first described here.
Network I/O is also briefly introduced here.

</li><li>- <a href="Printing.html">Printing Output</a>,
describes how <code>awk</code> programs can produce output with
<code>print</code> and <code>printf</code>.

</li><li>- <a href="Expressions.html">Expressions</a>,
describes expressions, which are the basic building blocks
for getting most things done in a program.

</li><li>- <a href="Patterns-and-Actions.html">Patterns, Actions, and Variables</a>,
describes how to write patterns for matching records, actions for
doing something when a record is matched, and the predefined variables
<code>awk</code> and <code>gawk</code> use.

</li><li>- <a href="Arrays.html">Arrays in <code>awk</code></a>,
covers <code>awk</code>&rsquo;s one-and-only data structure: the associative array.
Deleting array elements and whole arrays is described, as well as
sorting arrays in <code>gawk</code>.  The chapter also describes how
<code>gawk</code> provides arrays of arrays.

</li><li>- <a href="Functions.html">Functions</a>,
describes the built-in functions <code>awk</code> and <code>gawk</code> provide,
as well as how to define your own functions.  It also discusses how
<code>gawk</code> lets you call functions indirectly.
</li></ul>

</li><li> Part II shows how to use <code>awk</code> and <code>gawk</code> for problem solving.
There is lots of code here for you to read and learn from.
This part contains the following chapters:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- <a href="Library-Functions.html">A Library of <code>awk</code> Functions</a>, provides a number of functions meant to
be used from main <code>awk</code> programs.

</li><li>- <a href="Sample-Programs.html">Practical <code>awk</code> Programs</a>,
provides many sample <code>awk</code> programs.
</li></ul>

<p>Reading these two chapters allows you to see <code>awk</code>
solving real problems.
</p>
</li><li> Part III focuses on features specific to <code>gawk</code>.
It contains the following chapters:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- <a href="Advanced-Features.html">Advanced Features of <code>gawk</code></a>,
describes a number of advanced features.
Of particular note
are the abilities to control the order of array traversal,
have two-way communications with another process,
perform TCP/IP networking, and
profile your <code>awk</code> programs.

</li><li>- <a href="Internationalization.html">Internationalization with <code>gawk</code></a>,
describes special features for translating program
messages into different languages at runtime.

</li><li>- <a href="Debugger.html">Debugging <code>awk</code> Programs</a>, describes the <code>gawk</code> debugger.

</li><li>- <a href="Namespaces.html">Namespaces in <code>gawk</code></a>, describes how <code>gawk</code> allows variables and/or
functions of the same name to be in different namespaces.

</li><li>- <a href="Arbitrary-Precision-Arithmetic.html">Arithmetic and Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic with <code>gawk</code></a>,
describes advanced arithmetic facilities.

</li><li>- <a href="Dynamic-Extensions.html">Writing Extensions for <code>gawk</code></a>, describes how to add new variables and
functions to <code>gawk</code> by writing extensions in C or C++.
</li></ul>

</li><li> Part IV provides the appendices, the Glossary, and two licenses that cover
the <code>gawk</code> source code and this Web page, respectively.
It contains the following appendices:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- <a href="Language-History.html">The Evolution of the <code>awk</code> Language</a>,
describes how the <code>awk</code> language has evolved since
its first release to the present.  It also describes how <code>gawk</code>
has acquired features over time.

</li><li>- <a href="Installation.html">Installing <code>gawk</code></a>,
describes how to get <code>gawk</code>, how to compile it
on POSIX-compatible systems,
and how to compile and use it on different
non-POSIX systems.  It also describes how to report bugs
in <code>gawk</code> and where to get other freely
available <code>awk</code> implementations.


</li><li>- <a href="Notes.html">Implementation Notes</a>,
describes how to disable <code>gawk</code>&rsquo;s extensions, as
well as how to contribute new code to <code>gawk</code>,
and some possible future directions for <code>gawk</code> development.

</li><li>- <a href="Basic-Concepts.html">Basic Programming Concepts</a>,
provides some very cursory background material for those who
are completely unfamiliar with computer programming.

</li><li>- The <a href="Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, defines most, if not all, of the significant terms used
throughout the Web page.  If you find terms that you aren&rsquo;t familiar with,
try looking them up here.

</li><li>- <a href="Copying.html">GNU General Public License</a>, and
<a href="GNU-Free-Documentation-License.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>,
present the licenses that cover the <code>gawk</code> source code
and this Web page, respectively.
</li></ul>
