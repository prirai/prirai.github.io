<span id="Debugging-Concepts-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">14.1.2 Debugging Concepts</h4>

<span id="index-debugger-1"></span>
<p>Before diving in to the details, we need to introduce several
important concepts that apply to just about all debuggers.
The following list defines terms used throughout the rest of
this chapter:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><span id="index-call-stack"></span>
<span id="index-stack-frame-_0028debugger_0029"></span>
</dd>
<dt><em>Stack frame</em></dt>
<dd><p>Programs generally call functions during the course of their execution.
One function can call another, or a function can call itself (recursion).
You can view the chain of called functions (main program calls A, which
calls B, which calls C), as a stack of executing functions: the currently
running function is the topmost one on the stack, and when it finishes
(returns), the next one down then becomes the active function.
Such a stack is termed a <em>call stack</em>.
</p>
<p>For each function on the call stack, the system maintains a data area
that contains the function&rsquo;s parameters, local variables, and return value,
as well as any other &ldquo;bookkeeping&rdquo; information needed to manage the
call stack.  This data area is termed a <em>stack frame</em>.
</p>
<p><code>gawk</code> also follows this model, and gives you
access to the call stack and to each stack frame. You can see the
call stack, as well as from where each function on the stack was
invoked. Commands that print the call stack print information about
each stack frame (as detailed later on).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Breakpoint</em></dt>
<dd><span id="index-breakpoint"></span>
<p>During debugging, you often wish to let the program run until it
reaches a certain point, and then continue execution from there one
statement (or instruction) at a time.  The way to do this is to set
a <em>breakpoint</em> within the program.  A breakpoint is where the
execution of the program should break off (stop), so that you can
take over control of the program&rsquo;s execution.  You can add and remove
as many breakpoints as you like.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Watchpoint</em></dt>
<dd><span id="index-watchpoint-_0028debugger_0029"></span>
<p>A watchpoint is similar to a breakpoint.  The difference is that
breakpoints are oriented around the code: stop when a certain point in the
code is reached.  A watchpoint, however, specifies that program execution
should stop when a <em>data value</em> is changed.  This is useful, as
sometimes it happens that a variable receives an erroneous value, and it&rsquo;s
hard to track down where this happens just by looking at the code.
By using a watchpoint, you can stop whenever a variable is assigned to,
and usually find the errant code quite quickly.
