>While managing system resources, including processes, is a task for the local system administrator, it doesn't hurt a common user to know something about it, especially where his or her own processes and their optimal execution are concerned.</P
><P
>We will explain a little bit on a theoretical level about system performance, though not as far as hardware optimization and other advanced procedures.  Instead, we will study the daily problems a common user is confronted with, and actions such a user can take to optimally use the resources available.  As we learn in the next section, this is mainly a matter of thinking before acting.</P

To a system manager, on the other hand, it means much more:  the system admin has to optimize system performance for the whole system, including users, all programs and daemons.  System performance can depend on a thousand tiny things which are not accounted for with the <B

>4.3.4. Load</H2
><P
>In short:  the load depends on what is normal for your system.  My old P133 running a firewall, SSH server, file server, a route daemon, a sendmail server, a proxy server and some other services doesn't complain with 7 users connected; the load is still 0 on average.  Some (multi-CPU) systems I've seen were quite happy with a load of 67.  There is only one way to find out - check the load regularly if you want to know what's normal.  If you don't, you will only be able to measure system load from the response time of the command line, which is a very rough measurement since this speed is influenced by a hundred other factors.</P
><P
>Keep in mind that different systems will behave different with the same load average.  For example, a system with a graphics card supporting hardware acceleration will have no problem rendering 3D images, while the same system with a cheap VGA card will slow down tremendously while rendering.  My old P133 will become quite uncomfortable when I start the X server, but on a modern system you hardly notice the difference in the system load.</P

>4.3.5. Can I do anything as a user?</H2
><P
>A big environment can slow you down.  If you have lots of environment variables set (instead of shell variables), long search paths that are not optimized (errors in setting the path environment variable) and more of those settings that are usually made <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"on the fly"</SPAN
>, the system will need more time to search and read data.</P
><P
>In X, window managers and desktop environments can be real CPU-eaters.  A really fancy desktop comes with a price, even when you can download it for free, since most desktops provide add-ons ad infinitum.  Modesty is a virtue if you don't buy a new computer every year.</P

>4.3.5.1. Priority</H3
><P
>The priority or importance of a job is defined by it's <EM
>nice</EM
> number.  A program with a high nice number is friendly to other programs, other users and the system; it is not an important job.  The lower the nice number, the more important a job is and the more resources it will take without sharing them.</P
><P
>Making a job nicer by increasing its nice number is only useful for processes that use a lot of CPU time (compilers, math applications and the like).  Processes that always use a lot of I/O time are automatically rewarded by the system and given a higher priority (a lower nice number), for example keyboard input always gets highest priority on a system.</P
><P
>Defining the priority of a program is done with the <B
CLASS="command"

> command.</P
><P
>Most systems also provide the BSD <B

>4.3.5.2. CPU resources</H3
><P
>On every Linux system, many programs want to use the CPU(s) at the same time, even if you are the only user on the system.  Every program needs a certain amount of cycles on the CPU to run.  There may be times when there are not enough cycles because the CPU is too busy.  The <B
CLASS="command"
>uptime</B
> command is wildly inaccurate (it only displays averages, you have to know what is normal), but far from being useless.  There are some actions you can undertake if you think your CPU is to blame for the unresponsiveness of your system:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Run heavy programs when the load is low.  This may be the case on your system during the night.  See next section for scheduling.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Prevent the system from doing unnecessary work: stop daemons and programs that you don't use, use <B
CLASS="command"
>locate</B
> instead of a heavy <B
CLASS="command"
>find</B
>, ...</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Run big jobs with a low priority</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>If none of these solutions are an option in your particular situation, you may want to upgrade your CPU.  On a UNIX machine this is a job for the system admin.</P

>4.3.5.3. Memory resources</H3
><P
>When the currently running processes expect more memory than the system has physically available, a Linux system will not crash; it will start paging, or <EM
>swapping</EM
>, meaning the process uses the memory on disk or in swap space, moving contents of the physical memory (pieces of running programs or entire programs in the case of swapping) to disk, thus reclaiming the physical memory to handle more processes.  This slows the system down enormously since access to disk is much slower than access to memory.  The <B
CLASS="command"
>top</B
> command can be used to display memory and swap use.   Systems using glibc offer the <B
CLASS="command"
>memusage</B
> and <B
CLASS="command"
>memusagestat</B
> commands to visualize memory usage.</P
><P
>If you find that a lot of memory and swap space are being used, you can try:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Killing, stopping or renicing those programs that use a big chunk of memory</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Adding more memory (and in some cases more swap space) to the system.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Tuning system performance, which is beyond the scope of this document.  See the reading list in <A

>4.3.5.4. I/O resources</H3
><P
>While I/O limitations are a major cause of stress for system admins, the Linux system offers rather poor utilities to measure I/O performance.  The <B
CLASS="command"
>ps</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>vmstat</B
> and <B
CLASS="command"
>top</B
> tools give some indication about how many programs are waiting for I/O; <B
CLASS="command"
>netstat</B
> displays network interface statistics, but there are virtually no tools available to measure the I/O response to system load, and the <B
CLASS="command"
>iostat</B
> command gives a brief overview of general I/O usage.  Various graphical front-ends exist to put the output of these commands in a humanly understandable form.</P
><P
>Each device has its own problems, but the bandwidth available to network interfaces and the  bandwidth available to disks are the two primary causes of bottlenecks in I/O performance.</P
><P
>Network I/O problems:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Network overload:</P
><P
>The amount of data transported over the network is larger than the network's capacity, resulting in slow execution of every network related task for all users.  They can be solved by cleaning up the network (which mainly involves disabling protocols and services that you don't need) or by reconfiguring the network (for example use of subnets, replacing hubs with switches, upgrading interfaces and equipment).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Network integrity problems:</P
><P
>Occurs when data is transferred incorrectly.  Solving this kind of problem can only be done by isolating the faulty element and replacing it.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Disk I/O problems:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>per-process transfer rate too low:</P
><P
>Read or write speed for a single process is not sufficient.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>aggregate transfer rate too low:</P
><P
>The maximum total bandwidth that the system can provide to all programs that run is not enough.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>This kind of problem is more difficult to detect, and usually takes extra hardware in order to re-divide data streams over buses, controllers and disks, if overloaded hardware is cause of the problem.  One solution to solve this is a RAID array configuration optimized for input and output actions.  This way, you get to keep the same hardware.  An upgrade to faster buses, controlers and disks is usually the other option.</P
><P
>If overload is not the cause, maybe your hardware is gradually failing, or not well connected to the system.  Check contacts, connectors and plugs to start with.</P

><P
>As a non-privileged user, you can only influence your own processes.  We already saw how you can display processes and filter out processes that belong to a particular user, and what possible restrictions can occur.  When you see that one of your processes is eating too much of the system's resources, there are two things that you can do:</P

>In the case that you want the process to continue to run, but you also want to give the other processes on the system a chance, you can <B
CLASS="command"
>renice</B
> the process.  Appart from using the <B
CLASS="command"
>nice</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>renice</B
> commands, <B
CLASS="command"
>top</B
> is an easy way of spotting the troublesome process(es) and reducing priority.</P
><P
>Identify the process in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"NI"</SPAN
> column, it will most likely have a negative priority.  Type <B
CLASS="command"
>r</B
> and enter the process ID of the process that you want to renice.  Then enter the nice value, for instance <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"20"</SPAN
>.  That means that from now on, this process will take 1/5 of the CPU cycles at the most.</P
><P
>Examples of processes that you want to keep on running are emulators, virtual machines, compilers and so on.</P
><P
>If you want to stop a process because it hangs or is going totally berserk in the way of I/O consumption, file creation or use of other system resources, use the <B
CLASS="command"
>kill</B
> command.  If you have the opportunity, first try to kill the process softly, sending it the <EM
>SIGTERM</EM
> signal.  This is an instruction to terminate whatever it is doing, according to procedures as described in the code of the program:</P
