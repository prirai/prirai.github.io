>1.2.1. Is Linux difficult?</H2
><P
>Whether Linux is difficult to learn depends on the person you're asking.  
Experienced UNIX users will say no, because Linux is an ideal operating system 
for power-users and programmers, because it has been and is being developed by 
such people.
</P
><P
>Everything a good programmer can wish for is available: compilers, 
libraries, development and debugging tools.  These packages come with every 
standard Linux distribution.  The C-compiler is included for free - as opposed to many UNIX distributions demanding licensing fees for this tool.  All the 
documentation and manuals are there, and examples are often included to help you
get started in no time.  It feels like UNIX and switching between UNIX and 
Linux is a natural thing.
</P
><P
>In the early days of Linux, being an expert was kind of required to start 
using the system.  Those who mastered Linux felt better than the rest of the

tell a beginning user to <SPAN

>"RTFM"</SPAN
> (read the manuals).  While the 
manuals were on every system, it was difficult to find the documentation, and 
even if someone did, explanations were in such technical terms that the new user
became easily discouraged from learning the system.
</P
><P
>The Linux-using community started to realize that if Linux was ever to be 
an important player on the operating system market, there had to be some serious
changes in the accessibility of the system.

>1.2.2. Linux for non-experienced users</H2
><P
>Companies such as RedHat, SuSE and Mandriva have sprung up, providing 
packaged Linux distributions suitable for mass consumption.  They integrated a 
great deal of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), developed by the community, in 
order to ease management of programs and services.  As a Linux user today you 
have all the means of getting to know your system inside out, but it is no 
longer necessary to have that knowledge in order to make the system comply to 
your requests.
</P
><P
>Nowadays you can log in graphically and start all required applications 
without even having to type a single character, while you still have the ability
to access the core of the system if needed.  Because of its structure, Linux 
allows a user to grow into the system: it equally fits new and experienced 
users.  New users are not forced to do difficult things, while experienced users
are not forced to work in the same way they did when they first started learning
Linux.
</P
><P
>While development in the service area continues, great things are being 
done for desktop users, generally considered as the group least likely to know 
how a system works.  Developers of desktop applications are making incredible 
efforts to make the most beautiful desktops you've ever seen, or to make your 
Linux machine look just like your former MS Windows or an Apple workstation.  
The latest developments also include 3D acceleration support and support for USB
devices, single-click updates of system and packages, and so on.  Linux has 
these, and tries to present all available services in a logical form that 
ordinary people can understand.  Below is a short list containing some great 
examples; these sites have a lot of screenshots that will give you a glimpse of 
what Linux on the desktop can be like:
