>This guide is part of the Linux Documentation Project and aims to be the foundation for all other materials that you can get from
                the Project. As such, it provides you with the fundamental
                knowledge needed by anyone who wants to start working with a Linux system, while at
                the same time it tries to consciously avoid re-inventing the hot water. Thus, you
                can expect this book to be incomplete and full of links to sources of additional
                information on your system, on the Internet and in your system documentation.</P
><P
>The first chapter is an introduction to the subject on Linux; the next two discuss
                absolute basic commands. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss some more advanced but still basic
                topics. Chapter 6 is needed for continuing with the rest, since it discusses editing
                files, an ability you need to pass from Linux newbie to Linux user. The following
                chapters discuss somewhat more advanced topics that you will have to deal with in
                everyday Linux use.</P
><P
>All chapters come with exercises that will test your preparedness for the next chapter.</P
