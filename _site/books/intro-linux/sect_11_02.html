><P
>The <EM
>cdp</EM
> package comes with most distributions and provides <B
CLASS="command"
>cdp</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>cdplay</B
>, a text-based CD player.  Desktop managers usually include a graphical tool, such as the <B
CLASS="command"

> player in <SPAN

>, that can be started from a menu.</P
><P
>Be sure to understand the difference between an audio CD and a data CD.  
You do not have to mount an audio CD into the file system in order to listen to it.  This is because the data on such a CD are not Linux file system data; they are accessed and sent to the audio output channel directly, using a CD player program.  If your CD is a data CD containing <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.mp3</TT
> files, you will first need to mount it into the file system, and then use one of the programs that we discuss below in order to play the music.  How to mount CDs into the file system is explained in <A
HREF="sect_07_06.html#sect_07_06_05"
>Section 7.5.5</A
>.</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="command"
>cdparanoia</B
> tool from the package with the same name
 reads audio directly as data from the CD, without analog conversions, and writes data to a file or pipe in different formats, of which <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.wav</TT
> is probably the most popular.  Various tools for conversion to other formats, formats,  
 such as <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.mp3</TT
>, come with most distributions or are downloadable as separate packages.  The GNU project provides several CD playing, ripping and encoding tools, database managers; see the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/directory/audio/"
TARGET="_top"
>Free Software Directory, Audio section</A
> for detailed information.</P
><P
>Audio-CD creation is eased, among many others, with the <B
CLASS="command"
>kaudiocreator</B
> tool from the KDE suite.  It comes with clear information from the KDE Help Center.</P
