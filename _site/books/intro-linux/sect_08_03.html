However, you have to be really quick if you are the only one using this printer, since jobs are usually spooled and send to the printer in only seconds.  Once they arrive on the printer, it is too late to remove jobs using Linux tools.</P
><P
>What you can try in those cases, or in cases where the wrong print driver is configured and only rubbish comes out of the printer, is power off the printer.  However, that might not be the best course of action, as you might cause paper jams and other irregularities.</P

>If your job ID is not there and not on the printer, contact your system administrator.  If your job ID is listed in the output, check that the printer is currently printing.  If so, just wait, your job will get done in due time.</P

>If the printer is not printing, check that it has paper, check the physical connections to both electricity and data network.  If that's okay, the printer may need restarting.  Ask your system admin for advice.</P
><P
>In the case of a network printer, try printing from another host.  If the printer is reachable from your own host (see <A
HREF="chap_10.html"
>Chapter 10</A
> for the <B
CLASS="command"
>ping</B
> utility), you may try to put the formatted file on it, like <TT
CLASS="filename"
>file.ps</TT
> in case of a PostScript printer, using an FTP client.  If that works, your print system is misconfigured.  If it doesn't work, maybe the printer doesn't understand the format you are feeding it.</P
