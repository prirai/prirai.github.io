><P
>Offering a service to users can be approached in two ways.  A daemon or service can run in standalone mode, or it can be dependent on another service to be activated.</P
><P
>Network services that are heavily and/or continuously used, usually run in the standalone mode: they are independent program daemons that are always running.  They are most likely started up at system boot time, and they wait for requests on the specific connection points or ports for which they are set up to listen.  When a request comes, it is processed, and the listening continues until the next request.  A web server is a typical example: you want it to be available 24 hours a day, and if it is too busy it should create more listening instances to serve simultaneous users.  Other examples are the large software archives such as <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net"
TARGET="_top"
>Sourceforge</A
> or <A
HREF="http://tucows.com"
TARGET="_top"
>your Tucows mirror</A
>, which must handle thousands of FTP requests per day.</P
><P
>An example of a standalone network service on your home computer might be the <B
CLASS="command"
>named</B
> (name daemon), a caching name server.  Standalone services have their own processes running, you can check any time using <B
CLASS="command"
>ps</B

>On your home PC, things are usually a bit calmer.  You may have a small network, for instance, and you may have to transfer files from one PC to another from time to time, using FTP or Samba (for connectivity with MS Windows machines).  In those cases, starting all the services which you only need occasionally and having them run all the time would be a waste of resources.  So in smaller setups, you will find the necessary daemons dependent on a central program, that listen on all the ports of the services for which it is responsible.</P
><P
>This super-server, the Internet services daemon, is started up at system initialization time.  There are two common implementations: <B
CLASS="command"
>inetd</B
> and <B
CLASS="command"
>xinetd</B
> (the extended Internet services daemon).  One or the other is usually running on every Linux system:</P

><P
>Companies and organizations often want their users to use a proxy server.  Especially in environments with lots of users, a proxy server can enable faster downloads of web pages.  The proxy server stores web pages.  When a user asks for a web page that has already been requested previously, the proxy server will give that page to the user directly, so that s/he does not need to get it from the Internet, which would take longer.  Of course, measures can be taken so that the proxy server does a quick check and always serves the most recent version of a page.  In some environments, usage of the proxy server is compulsory, in other environments you may have the choice whether or not to use it.</P

>10.3.9.3. LDAP</H3
><P
>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a client-server system for accessing global or local directory services over a network.  On Linux, the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>OpenLDAP</SPAN
> implementation is used.  It includes <B
CLASS="command"
>slapd</B
>, a stand-alone server; <B
CLASS="command"
>slurpd</B
>, a stand-alone LDAP replication server; libraries implementing the LDAP protocol and a series of utilities, tools and sample clients.</P
><P
> The main benefit of using LDAP is the consolidation of certain types of information within your organization. For example, all of the different lists of users within your organization can be merged into one LDAP directory. This directory can be queried by any LDAP-enabled applications that need this information. It can also be accessed by users who need directory information.
</P
><P
>&#13;Other LDAP or X.500 Lite benefits include its ease of implementation (compared to X.500) and its well-defined Application Programming Interface (API), which means that the number of LDAP-enabled applications and LDAP gateways should increase in the future.
</P
><P
>&#13;On the negative side, if you want to use LDAP, you will need LDAP-enabled applications or the ability to use LDAP gateways. While LDAP usage should only increase, currently there are not very many LDAP-enabled applications available for Linux. Also, while LDAP does support some access control, it does not possess as many security features as X.500.
</P
><P
> Since LDAP is an open and configurable protocol, it can be used to store almost any type of information relating to a particular organizational structure.  Common examples are mail address lookups, central authentication in combination with PAM, telephone directories and machine configuration databases.</P
><P
>See your system specific information and the man pages for related commands such as <B
