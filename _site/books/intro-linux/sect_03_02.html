><P
>When you want the system to execute a command, you almost never have to give the full path to that command.  For example, we know that the <B
CLASS="command"
>ls</B
> command is in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin</TT
> directory (check with <B
CLASS="command"
>which <TT
CLASS="option"
>-a</TT
> <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>ls</I
></TT
></B
>), yet we don't have to enter the command <B
CLASS="command"
>/bin/ls</B
> for the computer to list the content of the current directory.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="varname"
>PATH</TT
> environment variable takes care of this.  This variable lists those directories in the system where executable files can be found, and thus saves the user a lot of typing and memorizing locations of commands.  So the path naturally contains a lot of directories containing <TT
CLASS="filename"
>bin</TT
> somewhere in their names, as the user below demonstrates.  The <B
CLASS="command"
>echo</B
> command is used to display the content (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"$"</SPAN
>) of the variable <TT
CLASS="varname"
>PATH</TT
>:</P

> are subsequently searched for the required program.  As soon as a match is found, the search is stopped, even if not every directory in the path has been searched.  This can lead to strange situations.  In the first example below, the user knows there is a program called <B
CLASS="command"
>sendsms</B

>3.2.2. Absolute and relative paths</H2
><P
>A path, which is the way you need to follow in the tree structure to reach a given file, can be described as starting from the trunk of the tree (the / or root directory).  In that case, the path starts with a slash and is called an absolute path, since there can be no mistake: only one file on the system can comply.</P
><P
>In the other case, the path doesn't start with a slash and confusion is possible between <TT
CLASS="filename"
>~/bin/wc</TT
> (in the user's home directory) and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>bin/wc</TT
> in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr</TT
>, from the previous example.  Paths that don't start with a slash are always relative.</P
><P
>In relative paths we also use the . and .. indications for the current and the parent directory.  A couple of practical examples:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>When you want to compile source code, the installation documentation often instructs you to run the command <B
CLASS="command"
>./configure</B
>, which runs the <EM
>configure</EM
> program located in the current directory (that came with the new code), as opposed to running another configure program elsewhere on the system.</P

><P
>The kernel is the heart of the system.  It manages the communication between the underlying hardware and the peripherals.  The kernel also makes sure that processes and daemons (server processes) are started and stopped at the exact right times.  The kernel has a lot of other important tasks, so many that there is a special kernel-development mailing list on this subject only, where huge amounts of information are shared.  It would lead us too far to discuss the kernel in detail.  For now it suffices to know that the kernel is the most important file on the system.</P

>3.2.3.2.1. What is a shell?</H4
><P
>When I was looking for an appropriate explanation on the concept of a <EM
>shell</EM
>, it gave me more trouble than I expected.  All kinds of definitions are available, ranging from the simple comparison that <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the shell is the steering wheel of the car"</SPAN
>, to the vague definition in the Bash manual which says that <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter,"</SPAN
> or an even more obscure expression, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a shell manages the interaction between the system and its users"</SPAN
>.  A shell is much more than that.</P
><P
>A shell can best be compared with a way of talking to the computer, a language.  Most users do know that other language, the point-and-click language of the desktop.  But in that language the computer is leading the conversation, while the user has the passive role of picking tasks from the ones presented.  It is very difficult for a programmer to include all options and possible uses of a command in the GUI-format.  Thus, GUIs are almost always less capable than the command or commands that form the backend.</P
><P
>The shell, on the other hand, is an advanced way of communicating with the system, because it allows for two-way conversation and taking initiative.  Both partners in the communication are equal, so new ideas can be tested.  The shell allows the user to handle a system in a very flexible way. An additional asset is that the shell allows for task automation.</P

CLASS="command"

>In the <TT

All files that change frequently, such as log files, mailboxes, lock files, spoolers etc. are kept in a subdirectory of <TT

>/var</TT
>.</P
><P
>As a security measure these files are usually kept in separate parts from the main system files, so we can keep a close eye on them and set stricter permissions where necessary.  A lot of these files also need more permissions than usual, like <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/tmp</TT
>, which needs to be writable for everyone.  A lot of user activity might be expected here, which might even be generated by anonymous Internet users connected to your system.  This is one reason why the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var</TT
> directory, including all its subdirectories, is usually on a separate partition.  This way, there is for instance no risk that a mail bomb, for instance, fills up the rest of the file system, containing more important data such as your programs and configuration files.</P

>Whatever you do, try to stick to the privileges granted to a normal user - don't go saving files directly under the root (/) of the file system, don't put them in <TT

>One of the main security systems on a UNIX system, which is naturally implemented on every Linux machine as well, is the log-keeping facility, which logs all user actions, processes, system events etc.  The configuration file of the so-called <EM
>syslogdaemon</EM
> determines which and how long logged information will be kept.  The default location of all logs is <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/log</TT
>, containing different files for access log, server logs, system messages etc.</P
><P
>In <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var</TT
> we typically find server data, which is kept here to separate it from critical data such as the server program itself and its configuration files.  A typical example on Linux systems is <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/www</TT
>, which contains the actual HTML pages, scripts and images that a web server offers.  The FTP-tree of an FTP server (data that can be downloaded by a remote client) is also best kept in one of <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var</TT
>'s subdirectories.  Because this data is publicly accessible and often changeable by anonymous users, it is safer to keep it here, away from partitions or directories with sensitive data.</P
><P
>On most workstation installations, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/spool</TT
> will at least contain an <TT
CLASS="filename"
>at</TT
> and a <TT
CLASS="filename"
>cron</TT
> directory, containing scheduled tasks.  In office environments this directory usually contains <TT
CLASS="filename"
>lpd</TT
> as well, which holds the print queue(s) and further printer configuration files, as well as the printer log files.</P
><P
>On server systems we will generally find <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/spool/mail</TT
>, containing incoming mails for local users, sorted in one file per user, the user's <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"inbox"</SPAN
>.  A related directory is <TT
CLASS="filename"
>mqueue</TT
>, the spooler area for unsent mail messages.  These parts of the system can be very busy on mail servers with a lot of users.  News servers also use the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/spool</TT
> area because of the enormous amounts of messages they have to process.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/lib/rpm</TT
> directory is specific to RPM-based (RedHat Package Manager) distributions; it is where RPM package information is stored.  Other package managers generally also store their data somewhere in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var</TT
>.</P
