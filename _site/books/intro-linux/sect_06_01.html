>6.1.1. Why should I use an editor?</H2
><P
>It is very important to be able to use at least one text mode editor.  Knowing how to use an editor on your system is the first step to independence.</P
><P
>We will need to master an editor by the next chapter as we need it to edit files that influence our environment.  As an advanced user, you may want to start writing scripts, or books, develop websites or new programs.  Mastering an editor will immensely improve your productivity as well as your capabilities.</P

>6.1.2. Which editor should I use?</H2
><P
>Our focus is on text editors, which can also be used on systems without a graphical environment and in terminal windows.  The additional advantage of mastering a text editor is in using it on remote machines.  Since you don't need to transfer the entire graphical environment over the network, working with text editors tremendously improves network speed.</P
><P
>There are, as usual, multiple ways to handle the problem.  Let's see what editors are commonly available:</P

>6.1.2.1. GNU Emacs</H3
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor, known on many UNIX and other systems.  The text being edited is visible on the screen and is updated automatically as you type your commands.  It is a real-time editor because the display is updated very frequently, usually after each character or pair of characters you type.  This minimizes the amount of information you must keep in your head as you edit.  <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> is called advanced because it provides facilities that go beyond simple insertion and deletion:  controlling subprocesses; automatic indentation of programs; viewing two or more files at once; editing formatted text; and dealing in terms of characters, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as expressions and comments in several different programming languages.</P
><P
><EM
>Self-documenting</EM
> means that at any time you can type a special character, <B
CLASS="keycap"
>Ctrl</B
>+<B
CLASS="keycap"
>H</B
>, to find out what your options are.  You can also use it to find out what any command does, or to find all the commands that pertain to a topic.  <EM
>Customizable</EM
> means that you can change the definitions of <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> commands in little ways.  For example, if you use a programming language in which comments start with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;**"</SPAN
> and end with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"**&#62;"</SPAN
>, you can tell the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> comment manipulation commands to use those strings.  Another sort of customization is rearrangement of the command set.  For example, if you prefer the four basic cursor motion commands (up, down, left and right) on keys in a diamond pattern on the keyboard, you can rebind the keys that way.</P
><P
><EM
>Extensible</EM
> means that you can go beyond simple customization and write entirely new commands, programs in the Lisp language that are run by <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
>'s own <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Lisp</SPAN
> interpreter.  <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> is an <EM
>online</EM
> extensible system, which means that it is divided into many functions that call each other, any of which can be redefined in the middle of an editing session.  Almost any part of <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> can be replaced without making a separate copy of all of <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
>.  Most of the editing commands of <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> are written in <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Lisp</SPAN
> already; the few exceptions could have been written in <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Lisp</SPAN
> but are written in C for efficiency.  Although only a programmer can write an extension, anybody can use it afterward.</P
><P
>When run under the X Window System (started as <B
CLASS="command"
>xemacs</B
>) <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> provides its own menus and convenient bindings to mouse buttons.  But <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Emacs</SPAN
> can provide many of the benefits of a window system on a text-only terminal.  For instance, you can look at or edit several files at once, move text between files, and edit files while running shell commands.</P

>6.1.2.2. Vi(m)</H3
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Vim</SPAN
> stands for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Vi IMproved"</SPAN
>.  It used to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Vi IMitation"</SPAN
>, but there are so many improvements that a name change was appropriate.  <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Vim</SPAN
> is a text editor which includes almost all the commands from the UNIX program <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
> and a lot of new ones.</P
><P
>Commands in the <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
> editor are entered using only the keyboard, which has the advantage that you can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on the screen, rather than moving your arm repeatedly to the mouse.  For those who want it, mouse support and a GUI version with scrollbars and menus can be activated.</P
><P
>We will refer to <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>vim</B
> throughout this book for editing files, while you are of course free to use the editor of your choice.  However, we recommend to at least get the <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
> basics in the fingers, because it is the standard text editor on almost all UNIX systems, while <B
CLASS="command"
>emacs</B
> can be an optional package.  There may be small differences between different computers and terminals, but the main point is that if you can work with <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
>, you can survive on any UNIX system.</P
><P
>Apart from the <B
CLASS="command"
>vim</B
> command, the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>vIm</SPAN
> packages may also provide <B
CLASS="command"
>gvim</B
>, the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Gnome</SPAN
> version of <B
CLASS="command"
>vim</B
>.  Beginning users might find this easier to use, because the menus offer help when you forgot or don't know how to perform a particular editing task using the standard <B
CLASS="command"
>vim</B
> commands.</P
