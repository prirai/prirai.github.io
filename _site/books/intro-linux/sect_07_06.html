><P
>Most people are surprised to see that they have a running, usable computer after installing Linux; most distributions contain ample support for video and network cards, monitors and other external devices, so there is usually no need to install extra drivers.  Also common tools such as office suites, web browsers, E-mail and other network client programs are included in the main distributions.  Even so, an initial installation might not meet your requirements.</P
><P
>If you just can't find what you need, maybe it is not installed on your system.  It may also be that you have the required software, but it does not do what it is supposed to do.  Remember that Linux moves fast, and software improves on a daily basis.  Don't waste your time troubleshooting problems that might already be resolved.</P
><P
>You can update your system or add packages to it at any time you want.  Most software comes in packages.  Extra software may be found on your installation CDs or on the Internet.  The website of your Linux distribution is a good place to start looking for additional software and contains instructions about how to install it on your type of Linux, see <A
HREF="app1.html"
>Appendix A</A
>.  Always read the documentation that comes with new software, and any installation guidelines the package might contain.  All software comes with a <TT
CLASS="filename"
>README</TT
> file, which you are very strongly advised to read.</P

><P
>RPM, the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>RedHat Package Manager</SPAN
>, is a powerful package manager that you can use to install, update and remove packages.  It allows you to search for packages and keeps track of the files that come with each package.  A system is built-in so that you can verify the authenticity of packages downloaded from the Internet.  Advanced users can build their own packages with RPM.</P
><P
>An RPM package  consists  of an archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the archive files. The meta-data includes  helper  scripts,  file attributes,  and  descriptive  information about the package.  Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to encapsulate software to be  installed,  and source  packages,  containing  the source code and recipe necessary to produce binary packages.</P
><P
>Many other distributions support RPM packages, among the popular ones RedHat Enterprise Linux, Mandriva (former Mandrake), Fedora Core and SuSE Linux.  Apart from the advice for your distribution, you will want to read <B

>The first thing you do after installing a new system is applying updates;
this applies to all operating systems and Linux is not different.</P

>The updates for most Linux systems can usually be found on a nearby site mirroring your distribution.  Lists of sites offering this service can be found at your distribution's web site, see <A
HREF="app1.html"
>Appendix A</A
>.</P
><P
>Updates should be applied regularly, daily if possible - but every couple of weeks would be a reasonable start.  You really should try to have the most recent version of your distribution, since Linux changes constantly.  As we said before, new features, improvements and bug fixes are supplied at a steady rhythm, and sometimes important security problems are addressed.</P
><P
>The good news is that most Linux distributions provide tools so that you don't have to upgrade tens of packages daily by hand.  The following sections give an overview of <EM
>package manager managers.</EM
>  There is much more to this subject, even regular updates of source packages is manageable automatically; we only list the most commonly known systems.  Always refer to the documentation for your specific distribution for advised procedures.</P

APT has its roots in the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, where it is the default manager for the Debian packages.  APT has been ported to work with RPM packages as well.  The main advantage of APT is that it is free and flexible to use.  It will allow you to set up systems similar to the distribution specific (and in some cases commercial) ones listed in the next sections.</P
