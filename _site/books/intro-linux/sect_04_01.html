>Now that we are more used to our environment and we are able to communicate a little bit with our system, it is time to study the processes we can start in more detail.  Not every command starts a single process.  Some commands initiate a series of processes, such as <B
CLASS="command"
>mozilla</B
>; others, like <B
CLASS="command"
>ls</B
>, are executed as a single command.</P
><P
>Furthermore, Linux is based on UNIX, where it has been common policy to have multiple users running multiple commands, at the same time and on the same system.  It is obvious that measures have to be taken to have the CPU manage all these processes, and that functionality has to be provided so users can switch between processes.  In some cases, processes will have to continue to run even when the user who started them logs out.  And users need a means to reactivate interrupted processes.</P

>4.1.2.1. Interactive processes</H3
><P
>Interactive processes are initialized and controlled through a terminal session.  In other words, there has to be someone connected to the system to start these processes; they are not started automatically as part of the system functions.  These processes can run in the foreground, occupying the terminal that started the program, and you can't start other applications as long as this process is running in the foreground.  Alternatively, they can run in the background, so that the terminal in which you started the program can accept new commands while the program is running.  Until now, we mainly focussed on programs running in the foreground - the length of time taken to run them was too short to notice - but viewing a file with the <B
CLASS="command"
>less</B
> command is a good example of a command occupying the terminal session.  In this case, the activated program is waiting for you to do something.  The program is still connected to the terminal from where it was started, and the terminal is only useful for entering commands this program can understand.  Other commands will just result in errors or unresponsiveness of the system.</P
><P
>While a process runs in the background, however, the user is not prevented from doing other things in the terminal in which he started the program, while it is running.</P
><P
>The shell offers a feature called <EM
>job control</EM
> which allows easy handling of multiple processes.  This mechanism switches processes between the foreground and the background.  Using this system, programs can also be started in the background immediately.</P
><P
>Running a process in the background is only useful for programs that don't need user input (via the shell).  Putting a job in the background is typically done when execution of a job is expected to take a long time.  In order to free the issuing terminal after entering the command, a trailing ampersand is added.  In the example, using graphical mode, we open an extra terminal window from the existing one:</P

>Most UNIX systems are likely to be able to run <B
CLASS="command"
>screen</B
>, which is useful when you actually want another shell to execute commands.  Upon calling <B
CLASS="command"
>screen</B
>, a new session is created with an accompanying shell and/or commands as specified, which you can then put out of the way.  In this new session you may do whatever it is you want to do.  All programs and operations will run independent of the issuing shell.  You can then detach this session, while the programs you started in it continue to run, even when you log out of the originating shell, and pick your <EM
>screen</EM
> up again any time you like.</P

>4.1.2.2. Automatic processes</H3
><P
>Automatic or batch processes are not connected to a terminal.  Rather, these are tasks that can be queued into a spooler area, where they wait to be executed on a FIFO (first-in, first-out) basis.  Such tasks can be executed using one of two criteria:</P

>At a certain date and time: done using the <B
CLASS="command"

></LI
><LI
><P
>At times when the total system load is low enough to accept extra jobs: done using the <B
CLASS="command"
>batch</B
> command.  By default, tasks are put in a queue where they wait to be executed until the system load is lower than 0.8.  In large environments, the system administrator may prefer batch processing when large amounts of data have to be processed or when tasks demanding a lot of system resources have to be executed on an already loaded system.  Batch processing is also used for optimizing system performance.</P

>Daemons are server processes that run continuously.  Most of the time, they are initialized at system startup and then wait in the background until their service is required.  A typical example is the networking daemon, <EM
>xinetd</EM
>, which is started in almost every boot procedure.  After the system is booted, the network daemon just sits and waits until a client program, such as an FTP client, needs to connect.</P

><P
>A new process is created because an existing process makes an exact copy of itself.  This child process has the same environment as its parent, only the process ID number is different.  This procedure is called <EM
>forking</EM
>.</P
><P
>After the forking process, the address space of the child process is overwritten with the new process data.  This is done through an <EM
>exec</EM
> call to the system.</P
><P
>The <EM
>fork-and-exec</EM
> mechanism thus switches an old command with a new, while the environment in which the new program is executed remains the same, including configuration of input and output devices, environment variables and priority.  This mechanism is used to create all UNIX processes, so it also applies to the Linux operating system.  Even the first process, <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
>, with process ID 1, is forked during the boot procedure in the so-called <EM
>bootstrapping</EM
> procedure.</P
><P
>This scheme illustrates the fork-and-exec mechanism.  The process ID changes after the fork procedure:</P

>There are a couple of cases in which <B

CLASS="command"
>init</B
>, as we already saw in the <B
CLASS="command"
>pstree</B
> example.   Many programs, for instance, <EM
>daemonize</EM
> their child processes, so they can keep on running when the parent stops or is being stopped.  A window manager is a typical example; it starts an <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
> process that generates a shell that accepts commands.  The window manager then denies any further responsibility and passes the child process to <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
>.  Using this mechanism, it is possible to change window managers without interrupting running applications.</P
><P
>Every now and then things go wrong, even in good families.  In an exceptional case, a process might finish while the parent does not wait for the completion of this process.  Such an unburied process is called a <EM

><P
>The return codes can then be interpreted by the parent, or in scripts.  The values of the return codes are program-specific.  This information can usually be found in the man pages of the specified program, for example the <B
CLASS="command"

> command returns <TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>-1</TT

>4.1.6. SUID and SGID</H2
><P
>As promised in the previous chapter, we will now discuss the special modes SUID and SGID in more detail.  These modes exist to provide normal users the ability to execute tasks they would normally not be able to do because of the tight file permission scheme used on UNIX based systems.  In the ideal situation special modes are used as sparsely as possible, since they include security risks.  Linux developers have generally tried to avoid them as much as possible.  The Linux <B
CLASS="command"
>ps</B
> version, for example, uses the information stored in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/proc</TT
> file system, which is accessible to everyone, thus avoiding exposition of sensitive system data and resources to the general public.  Before that, and still on older UNIX systems, the <B
CLASS="command"
>ps</B
> program needed access to files such as <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/mem</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/kmem</TT
>, which had disadvantages because of the permissions and ownerships on these files:</P

>While we generally try to avoid applying any special modes, it is sometimes necessary to use an SUID.  An example is the mechanism for changing passwords.  Of course users will want to do this themselves instead of having their password set by the system administrator.  As we know, user names and passwords are listed in the <TT

>SGID modes on a file don't occur nearly as frequently as SUID, because SGID often involves the creation of extra groups.  In some cases, however, we have to go through this trouble in order to build an elegant solution (don't worry about this too much -  the necessary groups are usually created upon installation).  This is the case for the <B
CLASS="command"
>write</B
> and <B
CLASS="command"
>wall</B
> programs, which are used to send messages to other users' terminals (ttys).  The <B
CLASS="command"
>write</B
> command writes a message to a single user, while <B
CLASS="command"
>wall</B
> writes to all connected users.</P
><P
>Sending text to another user's terminal or graphical display is normally not allowed.  In order to bypass this problem, a group has been created, which owns all terminal devices.  When the <B
CLASS="command"
>write</B
> and <B
CLASS="command"
>wall</B
> commands are granted SGID permissions, the commands will run using the access rights as applicable to this group, <EM
>tty</EM
> in the example.  Since this group has write access to the destination terminal, also a user having no permissions to use that terminal in any way can send messages to it.</P
><P
>In the example below, user <EM
>joe</EM
> first finds out on which terminal his correspondent is connected, using the <B
CLASS="command"
>who</B
> command.  Then he sends her a message using the <B
CLASS="command"
>write</B
> command.  Also illustrated are the access rights on the <B
CLASS="command"
>write</B
> program and on the terminals occupied by the receiving user: it is clear that others than the user owner have no permissions on the device, except for the group owner, which can write to it.</P
