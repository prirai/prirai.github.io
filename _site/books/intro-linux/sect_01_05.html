><P
>&#13;Although there are a large number of Linux implementations, you will find a lot 
of similarities in the different distributions, if only because every Linux 
machine is a box with building blocks that you may put together following your 
own needs and views.  Installing the system is only the beginning of a longterm 
relationship.  Just when you think you have a nice running system, Linux will 
stimulate your imagination and creativeness, and the more you realize what 
power the system can give you, the more you will try to redefine its limits. 
</P
><P
>Linux may appear different depending on the distribution, your hardware 
and personal taste, but the fundamentals on which all graphical and other 
interfaces are built, remain the same.  The Linux system is based on GNU tools 
(Gnu's Not UNIX), which provide a set of standard ways to handle and use the 
system.  All GNU tools are open source, so they can be installed on any system. 
Most distributions offer pre-compiled packages of most common tools, such as RPM
packages on RedHat and Debian packages (also called deb or dpkg) on Debian, so you needn't be a programmer 
to install a package on your system.  However, if you are and like doing things 
yourself, you will enjoy Linux all the better, since most distributions come 
with a complete set of development tools, allowing installation of new software 
purely from source code.  This setup also allows you to install software even if
it does not exist in a pre-packaged form suitable for your system.

>Many commercial applications are available for Linux, and for more 
information about these packages we refer to their specific documentation.  
Throughout this guide we will only discuss freely available software, which 
comes (in most cases) with a GNU license.
</P
><P
>To install missing or new packages, you will need some form of software 
management.  The most common implementations include RPM and dpkg.  RPM is the RedHat Package Manager, which is used on a variety of Linux 
systems, eventhough the name does not suggest this.  Dpkg is the Debian package 
management system, which uses an interface called <B
CLASS="command"
>apt-get</B
>, 
that can manage RPM packages as well.  <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Novell Ximian Red Carpet</SPAN
> is a third party 
implementation of RPM with a graphical front-end.  Other third party software 
vendors may have their own installation procedures, sometimes resembling the 
InstallShield and such, as known on MS Windows and other platforms.  As you 
advance into Linux, you will likely get in touch with one or more of these 
programs.

<A
HREF="sect_03_02.html#sect_03_02_03_01"
>Section 3.2.3.1</A
>) is not part of the GNU project but uses the
same license as GNU software.  A great majority of utilities and development 
tools (the <EM
>meat</EM
> of your system), which are not 
Linux-specific, are taken from the GNU project.  Because any usable system must 
contain both the kernel and at least a minimal set of utilities, some people 
argue that such a system should be called a <EM
>GNU/Linux</EM
> 
system.

>In order to obtain the highest possible degree of independence between 
distributions, this is the sort of Linux that we will discuss throughout this 
course.  If we are not talking about a GNU/Linux system, the specific 
distribution, version or program name will be mentioned.

>1.5.3. Which distribution should I install?</H2
><P
>Prior to installation, the most important factor is your hardware.  Since 
every Linux distribution contains the basic packages and can be built to meet 
almost any requirement (because they all use the Linux kernel), you only need to
consider if the distribution will run on your hardware.  LinuxPPC for example 
has been made to run on Apple and other PowerPCs and does not run on an 
ordinary x86 based PC.  LinuxPPC does run on the new Macs, but you can't use it 
for some of the older ones with ancient bus technology.  Another tricky case is 
Sun hardware, which could be an old SPARC CPU or a newer UltraSparc, both 
requiring different versions of Linux.</P
><P
>Some Linux distributions are optimized for certain processors, such as 
Athlon CPUs, while they will at the same time run decent enough on the standard 
486, 586 and 686 Intel processors.  Sometimes distributions for special CPUs 
are not as reliable, since they are tested by fewer people.
</P
><P
>Most Linux distributions offer a set of programs for generic PCs with 
special packages containing optimized kernels for the x86 Intel based CPUs.  
These distributions are well-tested and maintained on a regular basis, focusing 
on reliant server implementation and easy installation and update procedures.  
Examples are Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, SuSE and Mandriva, which are by far the most popular Linux 
systems and generally considered easy to handle for the beginning user, while 
not blocking professionals from getting the most out of their Linux machines.  
Linux also runs decently on laptops and middle-range servers.  Drivers for new 
hardware are included only after extensive testing, which adds to the stability 
of a system.</P
><P
>While the standard desktop might be <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Gnome</SPAN
> on one system, another might 
offer <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> by default.  Generally, both <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Gnome</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> are available for all major Linux distributions.   Other window and desktop managers are available for more advanced users.</P
><P
>The standard installation process allows users to choose between different basic
setups, such as a workstation, where all packages needed for everyday use and 
development are installed, or a server installation, where different network 
services can be selected.  Expert users can install every combination of 
packages they want during the initial installation process.
</P
><P
>The goal of this guide is to apply to all Linux distributions.  For your 
own convenience, however, it is strongly advised that beginners stick to a 
mainstream distribution, supporting all common hardware and applications by 
default.  The following are very good choices for novices:
