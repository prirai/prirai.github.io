><P
>The Linux security model is based on the one used on UNIX systems, and is as rigid as the UNIX security model (and sometimes even more), which is already quite robust.  On a Linux system, every file is owned by a user and a group user.  There is also a third category of users, those that are not the user owner and don't belong to the group owning the file.  For each category of users, read, write and execute permissions can be granted or denied.</P
><P
>We already used the <EM
>long</EM
> option to list files using the <B
CLASS="command"
>ls <TT
CLASS="option"
>-l</TT
></B
> command, though for other reasons.  This command also displays file permissions for these three user categories; they are indicated by the nine characters that follow the first character, which is the file type indicator at the beginning of the file properties line.  As seen in the examples below, the first three characters in this series of nine display access rights for the actual user that owns the file.  The next three are for the group owner of the file, the last three for other users.  The permissions are always in the same order: read, write, execute for the user, the group and the others.  Some examples:</P

>Each UNIX-like system has a system function for creating new files, which is called each time a user uses a program that creates new files, for instance, when downloading a file from the Internet, when saving a new text document and so on.  This function creates both new files and new directories.  Full read, write and execute permission is granted to everybody when creating a new directory.  When creating a new file, this function will grant read and write permissions for everybody, but set execute permissions to none for all user categories.  This, before the mask is applied, a directory has permissions <EM
>777</EM
> or <EM
>rwxrwxrwx</EM
>, a plain file <EM
>666</EM
> or <EM
>rw-rw-rw-</EM
>.</P
><P
>The <EM
>umask</EM
> value is subtracted from these default permissions after the function has created the new file or directory.  Thus, a directory will have permissions of <EM
>775</EM
> by default, a file <EM
>664</EM
>, if the mask value is <EM
>(0)002</EM
>.  This is demonstrated in the example below:</P

>Sticky bit mode: After execution of a job, the command is kept in the system memory.  Originally this was a feature used a lot to save memory: big jobs are loaded into memory only once.  But these days memory is inexpensive and there are better techniques to manage it, so it is not used anymore for its optimizing capabilities on single files.  When applied to an entire directory, however, the sticky bit has a different meaning.  In that case, a user can only change files in this directory when she is the user owner of the file or when the file has appropriate permissions.  This feature is used on directories like <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/tmp</TT
>, that have to be accessible for everyone, but where it is not appropriate for users to change or delete each other's data.  The sticky bit is indicated by a <EM
>t</EM
