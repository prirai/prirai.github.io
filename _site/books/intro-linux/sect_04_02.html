>4.2.1. Introduction</H2
><P
> One of the most powerful aspects of Linux concerns its open method of starting and stopping the operating system, where it loads specified programs using their particular configurations, permits you to change those configurations to control the boot process, and shuts down in a graceful and organized way.</P
><P
> Beyond the question of controlling the boot or shutdown process, the open nature of Linux makes it much easier to determine the exact source of most problems associated with starting up or shutting down your system. A basic understanding of this process is quite beneficial to everybody who uses a Linux system.</P
><P
>A lot of Linux systems use <B
CLASS="command"
>lilo</B
>, the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LInux LOader</SPAN
> for booting operating systems.  We will only discuss GRUB, however, which is easier to use and more flexible.  Should you need information about <B
CLASS="command"
>lilo</B
>, refer to the man pages and HOWTOs.  Both systems support dual boot installations, we refer to the HOWTOs on this subject for practical examples and background information.</P

>4.2.2. The boot process</H2
><P
>When an x86 computer is booted, the processor looks at the end of the system memory for the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and runs it. The BIOS program is written into permanent read-only memory and is always available for use. The BIOS provides the lowest level interface to peripheral devices and controls the first step of the boot process.</P
><P
> The BIOS tests the system, looks for and checks peripherals, and then looks for a drive to use to boot the system. Usually it checks the floppy drive (or CD-ROM drive on many newer systems) for bootable media, if present, and then it looks to the hard drive. The order of the drives used for booting is usually controlled by a particular BIOS setting on the system.  Once Linux is installed on the hard drive of a system, the BIOS looks for a Master Boot Record (MBR) starting at the first sector on the first hard drive, loads its contents into memory, then passes control to it.</P
><P
> This MBR contains instructions on how to load the GRUB (or LILO) boot-loader, using a pre-selected operating system.  The MBR then loads the boot-loader, which takes over the process (if the boot-loader is installed in the MBR). In the default Red Hat Linux configuration, GRUB uses the settings in the MBR to display boot options in a menu.  Once GRUB has received the correct instructions for the operating system to start, either from its command line or configuration file, it finds the necessary boot file and hands off control of the machine to that operating system.</P
></DIV

CLASS="sect2"
><H2
CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="sect_04_02_03"
></A
>4.2.3. GRUB features</H2
><P
>This boot method is called <EM
>direct loading</EM
> because instructions are used to directly load the operating system, with no intermediary code between the boot-loaders and the operating system's main files (such as the kernel). The boot process used by other operating systems may differ slightly from the above, however. For example, Microsoft's DOS and Windows operating systems completely overwrite anything on the MBR when they are installed without incorporating any of the current MBR's configuration. This destroys any other information stored in the MBR by other operating systems, such as Linux. The Microsoft operating systems, as well as various other proprietary operating systems, are loaded using a chain loading boot method. With this method, the MBR points to the first sector of the partition holding the operating system, where it finds the special files necessary to actually boot that operating system.</P
><P
>&#13;GRUB supports both boot methods, allowing you to use it with almost any operating system, most popular file systems, and almost any hard disk your BIOS can recognize.</P
><P
>GRUB contains a number of other features; the most important include:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>GRUB provides a true command-based, pre-OS environment on x86 machines to allow maximum flexibility in loading operating systems with certain options or gathering information about the system.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>GRUB supports Logical Block Addressing (LBA) mode, needed to access many IDE and all SCSI hard disks.  Before LBA, hard drives could encounter a 1024-cylinder limit, where the BIOS could not find a file after that point.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>GRUB's configuration file is read from the disk every time the system boots, preventing you from having to write over the MBR every time you change the boot options.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>A full description of GRUB may be found by issuing the <B
CLASS="command"
>info <TT

>4.2.4. Init</H2
><P
>The kernel, once it is loaded, finds <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
> in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>sbin</TT
> and executes it.</P
><P
>When <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
> starts, it becomes the parent or grandparent of all of the processes that start up automatically on your Linux system. The first thing <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
> does, is reading its initialization file, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/inittab</TT
>.  This instructs <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
> to read an initial configuration script for the environment, which sets the path, starts swapping, checks the file systems, and so on. Basically, this step takes care of everything that your system needs to have done at system initialization: setting the clock, initializing serial ports and so forth.</P
><P
> Then <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
> continues to read the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/inittab</TT
> file, which describes how the system should be set up in each run level and sets the default <EM
>run level</EM
>.  A run level is a configuration of processes.  All UNIX-like systems can be run in different process configurations, such as the single user mode, which is referred to as run level 1 or run level S (or s).  In this mode, only the system administrator can connect to the system.  It is used to perform maintenance tasks without risks of damaging the system or user data.  Naturally, in this configuration we don't need to offer user services, so they will all be disabled.  Another run level is the reboot run level, or run level 6, which shuts down all running services according to the appropriate procedures and then restarts the system.</P

>4.2.5. Init run levels</H2
><P
> The idea behind operating different services at different run levels essentially revolves around the fact that different systems can be used in different ways. Some services cannot be used until the system is in a particular state, or <EM
>mode</EM
>, such as being ready for more than one user or having networking available.</P
><P
>&#13;There are times in which you may want to operate the system in a lower mode.  Examples are fixing disk corruption problems in run level 1 so no other users can possibly be on the system, or leaving a server in run level 3 without an X session running. In these cases, running services that depend upon a higher system mode to function does not make sense because they will not work correctly anyway. By already having each service assigned to start when its particular run level is reached, you ensure an orderly start up process, and you can quickly change the mode of the machine without worrying about which services to manually start or stop.</P
