><P
>A Linux system can have a lot to suffer from, but it usually suffers only during office hours.  Whether in an office environment, a server room or at home, most Linux systems are just idling away during the morning, the evening, the nights and weekends.  Using this idle time can be a lot cheaper than buying those machines you'd absolutely need if you want everything done at the same time.</P

><P
>The Info page on sleep is probably one of the shortest there is.  All <B

> does is wait.  By default the time to wait is expressed in seconds.</P
><P
>So why does it exist?  Some practical examples:</P
><P
>Somebody calls you on the phone, you say "Yes I'll be with you in half an hour" but you're about drowned in work as it is and bound to forget your lunch:</P

>1800</I
></TT
>; echo <TT

><I
>"Lunch time.."</I
></TT
>) &#38;</B
> </P
><P
>When you can't use the <B
CLASS="command"
>at</B
> command for some reason, it's five o'clock, you want to go home but there's still work to do and right now somebody is eating system resources:</P
><P
><B
CLASS="command"
>(sleep <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>10000</I
></TT
>; myprogram) &#38;</B
> </P
><P
>Make sure there's an auto-logout on your system, and that you log out or lock your desktop/office when submitting this kind of job, or run it in a <B
CLASS="command"
>screen</B
> session.</P
><P
>When you run a series of printouts of large files, but you want other users to be able to print in between:</P
><P
><B
CLASS="command"
>lp <TT
CLASS="filename"
>lotoftext</TT

HREF="sect_04_04.html#sect_04_04_04"
>Section 4.4.4</A
> the next section.  For example, jobs are often run at exactly 1 o'clock in the morning (e.g. system indexing to update a standard locate database), so entering a time of 0100 may easily slow your system down rather than fire it up.  To prevent jobs from running all at the same time, you may also use the <B
CLASS="command"
>batch</B
> command, which queues processes and feeds the work in the queue to the system in an evenly balanced way, preventing excessive bursts of system resource usage.  See the Info pages for more information.</P

>4.4.4. Cron and crontab</H2
><P
>The cron system is managed by the <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
> daemon.  It gets information about which programs and when they should run from the system's and users' crontab entries.  Only the root user has access to the system crontabs, while each user should only have access to his own crontabs.  On some systems (some) users may not have access to the cron facility.</P
><P
>At system startup the cron daemon searches <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/spool/cron/</TT
> for crontab entries which are named after accounts in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/passwd</TT
>, it searches <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/cron.d/</TT
> and it searches <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/crontab</TT
>, then uses this information every minute to check if there is something to be done.  It executes commands as the user who owns the crontab file and mails any output of commands to the owner.</P
><P
>On systems using <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Vixie</SPAN
> cron, jobs that occur hourly, daily, weekly and monthly are kept in separate directories in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc</TT
> to keep an overview, as opposed to the standard UNIX cron function, where all tasks are entered into one big file.</P
