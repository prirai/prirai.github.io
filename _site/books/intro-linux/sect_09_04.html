><P
>Encryption is synonym to secrecy.  In the context of backups, encryption can be very useful, for instance if you need to leave your backed up data in a place where you can not control access, such as the server of your provider.</P
><P
>Apart from that, encryption can be applied to E-mails as well: normally, mail is not encrypted and it is often sent in the open over the netwerk or the Internet.  If your message contains sensitive information, better encrypt it.</P

><P
>In this guide we will only discuss the very simple usage of the encryption tools and show what you will need in order to generate an encryption key and use it to encrypt data for yourself, which you can then safely store in a public place.  More advanced usage directions can be found in the man pages of the various commands.</P

>9.4.2. Generate a key</H2
><P
>Before you can start encrypting your data, you need to create a pair of keys.  The pair consists of a private and a public key.  You can send the public key to correspondents, who can use it to encrypt data for you, which you decrypt with your private key.  You always keep the private key, never share it with somebody else, or they will be able to decrypt data that is only destined for you.  Just to make sure that no accidents happen, the private key is protected with a password.  The key pair is created using this command:</P

>Now enetr your password.  This can be a phrase, the longer, the better, the only condition is that you should be able to remember it at all times.  For verification, you need to enter the same phrase again.</P
><P
>Now the key pair is generated by a program that spawns random numbers and that is, among other factors, fed with the activity data of the system.  So it is a good idea to start some programs now, to move the mouse cursor or to type some random characters in a terminal window.  That way, the chances to generate a number that contains lots of different digits will be much bigger and the key will be more difficult to crack.</P
