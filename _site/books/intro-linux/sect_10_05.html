><P
>There are a couple of different ways to execute commands or run programs on a remote machine and have the output, be it text or graphics, sent to your workstation.  The connections can be secure or insecure.  While it is of course advised to use secure connections instead of transporting your password over the network unencrypted, we will discuss some practical applications of the older (unsafe) mechanisms, as they are still useful in a modern networked environment, such as for troubleshooting or running exotic programs.</P

><P
>The <B
CLASS="command"
>rlogin</B
> and <B
CLASS="command"
>rsh</B
> commands for remote login and remote execution of commands are inherited from UNIX.  While seldom used because they are blatantly insecure, they still come with almost every Linux distribution for backward compatibility with UNIX programs.</P
><P
>Telnet, on the other hand, is still commonly used, often by system and network administrators.  Telnet is one of the most powerful tools for remote access to files and remote administration, allowing connections from anywhere on the Internet.  Combined with an X server, remote graphical applications can be displayed locally.  There is no difference between working on the local machine and using the remote machine.</P
><P
>Because the entire connection is unencrypted, allowing <B
CLASS="command"
>telnet</B
> connections involves taking high security risks.  For normal remote execution of programs, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Secure SHell</SPAN
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> is advised.  We will discuss the secure method later in this section.</P
><P
>However, <B

><P
>As we already explained in Chapter 7 (see <A
HREF="sect_07_03.html#sect_07_03_03"
>Section 7.3.3</A
>), the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X Window</SPAN
> system comes with an X server which serves graphics to clients that need a display.</P
><P
>It is important to realize the distinction between the X server and the X client application(s).  The X server controls the display directly and is responsible for all input and output via keyboard, mouse and display.  The X client, on the other hand, does not access the input and output devices directly.  It communicates with the X server which handles input and output.  It is the X client which does the real work, like computing values, running applications and so forth.  The X server only opens windows to handle input and output for the specified client.</P
><P
>In normal operation (graphical mode), every Linux workstation is an X server to itself, even if it only runs client applications.  All the applications you are running (for example, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Gimp</SPAN
>, a terminal window, your browser, your office application, your CD playing tool, and so on) are clients to your X server.  Server and client are running on the same machine in this case.</P
><P
>This client/server nature of the X system makes it an ideal environment for remote execution of applications and programs.  Because the process is actually being executed on the remote machine, very little CPU power is needed on the local host.  Such machines, purely acting as servers for X, are called X terminals and were once very popular.  More information may be found in the <A

>In order to ease management of MS Windows hosts, recent Linux distributions support the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which is implemented in the <B
