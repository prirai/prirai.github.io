=====================
Who Is This Book For?
=====================

---------------
Target Audience
---------------

The target audience for this book is people with some experience of programming in a non-functional programming language:

* procedural languages like Fortran, Algol, C etc, etc
* object orientated languages like C++, Java, Ruby etc, etc
* scripting languages like PHP, Python, Perl etc, etc

(I appreciate that these categories probably fail as strict Comp Sci definitions.)

If you have already mastered a 'conventional' Functional Programming language this book **might not** be for you - there are good books about learning a variety of Lisps out there. Functional Programming languages include:

* Lisp and it dialects like Scheme, Clojure, Common Lisp (CL) etc, etc
* Erlang
* Haskell

(Of course the majority of the worlds 'programmers' are end-users who are pragmatic folks using Excel, Open Office or, natch, Hypernumbers. This book is not really aimed at end-user spreadsheet 'programmers' either.)

How Much Experience Is Needed?
------------------------------

If you can write a small programme to do something in a non-functional programming language from scratch then you should be experienced enough.
