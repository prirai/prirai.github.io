Who This Book Is For
--------------------

This book is for people who can already programme, but who are not familiar with functional programming. It is suitable for most programmers with experience in popular programming languages like Ruby, Java, Python, Perl, C, C++ and so on.

It assumes that the reader can get a clean install of Ubuntu GNU/Linux up and running.

---------------------------
How This Book Teaches Elisp
---------------------------

This book teaches Elisp through the medium of Emacs. Emacs has a *scratch* window in which arbitrary Elisp expressions can be evaluated. Initial lessons will use the *scratch* window. Later lessons will move on to creating external lisp files and loading them into Emacs to use them.
