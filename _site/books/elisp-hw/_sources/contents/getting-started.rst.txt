What Needs To Be Installed
--------------------------

This book assumes that you have a clean install of Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop which can be obtained `from Ubuntu`_.

Having created a clean install the Emacs package (version 23.1+1-4ubunutu7) should be installed.

This can be done by:

* selecting the Ubuntu menu `System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager`
* use the Quick search input box in the top right
* select `emacs` by clicking the tick box in the first column
* click the `Apply` button and click `Apply` in the Summary dialog box

A dialog box entitled `Applying Changes` will appear. When the changes have been applied you may close the dialog box.

**Please** only install the Emacs package as indicated. The exercises in this book are predicated on that being the case.

How This Book Will Work
-----------------------

The work on learning Elisp will take place within an X-Windows enabled version of Emacs as shown below.
