>1.1. openMosix HOWTO</H1
><P
>In the beginning there was Mosix, then came openMosix, in my opinion a
more interesting project. Not only from a technical point of view but
also due to the more correct license.  I made the decision to focus
this HOWTO on openMosix rather than on Mosix, mainly based on the fact
that openMosix has a bigger userbase. (Moshe Bar states that about 97%
of the old Mosix community has switched over to openMosix.) 
(20020705) Given the above, lots of information might be valuable to
both users of Mosix and openMosix.  I decided to  split the
HOWTO.  The latest release of the Mosix HOWTO, containing info about
both Mosix and OpenMosix will be 0.20 My intention is to focus on the
openMosix HOWTO, however not neglecting the Mosix users.

>1.2. Introduction</H1
><P
>&#13;  This document gives a brief description of openMosix, a software package
  that turns a network of GNU/Linux computers into a computer cluster.
  Along the way, some background to parallel processing is given, as
  well as a brief introduction to programs that make special use of
  openMosix's capabilities. The HOWTO expands on the documentation as it
  provides more background information and discusses the quirks of
  various distributions.</P
><P
>  Since the creation of this HOWTO some people of the Mosix team created 
openMosix (more info later), initially 
both openMosix and Mosix were  discussed 
in this HOWTO. 

Although lots of information might be valuable to both users of Mosix and 
openMosix. I decided to  split the HOWTO. The latest relase of the 
Mosix HOWTO, containing info about both Mosix and OpenMosix will be 0.20 
and can be found on

></A
></P
><P
>  Kris Buytaert got involved in this piece of work when Scot Stevenson was 
  looking for somebody to take over the Job: this was during February 2002.
  While initially we discussed both Mosix and openMosix, this version 
  of the HOWTO now mainly focuses on openMosix.  Please note that 
  the document often still mentions Mosix where it should read openMosix.</P
><P
>&#13;
You will notice that some of the headings are not as serious as they
should be. Scot had planned to write the HOWTO in a slightly lighter
style, as the world (and even the part of the world with a burping
penguin as a mascot) is full of technical literature that is deadly.
Therefore some parts still have these comments.&#13;</P

>2.1. A very, very brief introduction to clustering</H1
><P
>&#13; Most of the time, your computer is bored. Start a program like xload
  or top that monitors your system use, and you will probably find that
  your processor load is not even hitting the 1.0 mark. If you have two
  or more computers, chances are that at any given time, at least one
  of them is doing nothing. Unfortunately, when you really do need CPU
 power - during a C++ compile, or encoding Ogg Vorbis music files -
 you need a lot of it at once. The idea behind clustering is to spread
  these loads among all available computers, using the resources that
  are free on other machines.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13; The basic unit of a cluster is a single computer, also called a
  "node". Clusters can grow in size - they "scale" - by adding more
  machines. A cluster as a whole will be more powerful the faster the
  individual computers and the faster their connection speeds are. In
  addition, the operating system of the cluster must make the best use
  of the available hardware in response to changing conditions. This
  becomes more of a challenge if the cluster is composed of different
  hardware types (a "heterogeneous" cluster), if the configuration of
  the cluster changes unpredictably (machines joining and leaving the
  cluster), and the loads cannot be predicted ahead of time.  &#13;</P

>Fail-over Clusters</EM

computers with a separate heartbeat connection between the 2 hosts.
The Heartbeat connection between the 2 machines is being used to
monitor whether all the services are still in use: as soon as a
service on one machine breaks down the other machines try to take
over.</P

><P
>With load-balancing clusters the concept is that when a request for
say a web-server comes in, the cluster checks which machine is the
least busy and then sends the request to that machine.  Actually most
of the times a Load-balancing cluster is also a Fail-over cluster but
with the extra load balancing functionality and often with more nodes.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The last variation of clustering is the High Performance Computing
Cluster: the machines are being configured specially to give data
centers that require extreme performance what they need.  Beowulfs
have been developed especially to give research facilities the
computing speed they need. These kind of clusters also have some
load-balancing features; they try to spread different processes to
more machines in order to gain performance. But what it mainly comes
down to in this situation is that a process is being parallelized and
that routines that can be ran separately will be spread on different
machines instead of having to wait till they get done one after
another.</P

><P
>Most common known examples of loadbalancing and failover clusters are webfarms, databases or firewalls.
People want to have a 99,99999% uptime for their services, the internet is open 24/24 7/7/ 365/365 
not unlike in the old days when you could shut down your server when the office closed. </P
><P
>People that are in need of cpu cycles often can afford to schedule downtime for their environments, 
as long as they can use the maximum power of their machines when they need it.</P

>&#13;Traditionally Supercomputers have only been built by a 
selected number of vendors: a company or organization that required
the performance of such a machine had to have a huge budget available
for its Supercomputer.  Lots of universities could not afford the
costs of a Supercomputer by themselves, therefore other alternatives
were being researched by them.  The concept of a cluster was born when
people first tried to spread different jobs over more computers and
then gather back the data those jobs produced.  With cheaper and more
common hardware available to everybody, results similar to real
Supercomputers were only to be dreamed of during the first years, but
as the PC platform developed further, the performance gap between a
Supercomputer and a cluster of multiple personal computers became
smaller.&#13;</P

><P
>&#13;  The openMosix software package turns networked computers running
  GNU/Linux into a cluster. It automatically balances the load between
  different nodes of the cluster, and nodes can join or leave the
  running cluster without disruption of the service. The load is
  spread out among nodes according to their connection and CPU speeds.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;  Since openMosix is part of the kernel and maintains full
  compatibility with Linux, a user's programs, files, and other
  resources will all work as before without any further changes. The
  casual user will not notice the difference between a Linux and an
  openMosix system. To her, the whole cluster will function as one
  (fast) GNU/Linux system.&#13;</P
><P
>openMosix is a Linux-kernel patch which provides full compatibility
with standard Linux for IA32-compatible platforms. The internal
load-balancing algorithm transparently migrates processes to other
cluster members.  The advantage is a better load-sharing between the
nodes. The cluster itself tries to optimize utilization at any time
(of course the sysadmin can affect the automatic load-balancing by
manual configuration during runtime).</P
><P
>This transparent process-migration feature makes the whole cluster
look like a BIG SMP-system with as many processors as available
cluster-nodes (of course multiplied with X for X-processor systems
such as dual/quad systems and so on).  openMosix also provides a
powerful optimized File System (oMFS) for HPC-applications, which
unlike NFS provides cache, time stamp and link consistency.</P

>Announcing MO6 for BSD/OS 3.0
Oren Laadan (orenl@cs.huji.ac.il)
Tue, 9 Sep 1997 19:50:12 +0300 (IDT)

Hi:

We are pleased to announce the availability of MO6 Version 3.0
Release 1.04 (beta-4) - compatible with BSD/OS 3.0, patch level
K300-001 through M300-029.

MO6 is a 6 processor version of the MOSIX multicomputer enhancements
of BSD/OS for a PC Cluster. If you have 2 to 6 PC's connected by a
LAN, you can experience truly multi-computing environment by using
the MO6 enhancements.

The MO6 Distribution
--------------------
MO6 is available either in "source" or "binary" distribution. It is
installed as a patch to BSD/OS, using an interactive installation
script.

MO6 is available at http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/mirrors/mosix/
or at our site: http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/mosix/

Main highlights of the current release:
--------------------------------------
- Memory ushering (depletion prevention) by process migration.
- Improved installation procedure.
- Enhanced migration control.
- Improved administration tools.
- More user utilities.
- More documentation and new man pages.
- Dynamic configurations.

Please send feedback and comments to mosix@cs.huji.ac.il.

GNU/Linux was chosen as a development platform for the 7th
incarnation in 1999.

Early  1999 Mosix M06 Beta was released for Linux 2.2.1 

At the end of 2001 and early 2002 openMosix, the open version of Mosix was 
born (more in the next paragraph).  </P

>2.2.2. openMosix</H2
><P
>openMosix is in addition to whatever you find at mosix.org and in full 
appreciation and respect for Prof. Barak's leadership in the
outstanding Mosix project.</P
><P
>Moshe Bar has been involved for a number of years with the Mosix
project (www.mosix.com) and was co-project manager of the Mosix
project and general manager of the commercial Mosix company.</P
><P
>After a difference of opinions on the commercial future of Mosix, he
has started a new clustering company - Qlusters, Inc. - and
Prof. Barak has decided not to participate for the moment in this
venture (although he did seriously consider joining) and held long
running negotiations with investors.

It appears that Mosix is not any longer supported openly as a GPL
project.  Because there is a significant user base out there (about
1000 installations world-wide), Moshe Bar has decided to continue the
development and support of the Mosix project under a new name:
openMosix and under the full GPL2 license. Whatever code in openMosix
comes from the old Mosix project is Copyright 2002 by Amnon Barak. All
the new code is Copyright 2002 by Moshe Bar.</P
><P
>There could (and will) be significant changes in the architecture of
the future openMosix versions.  New concepts about auto-configuration,
node-discovery and new user-land tools are being discussed in the
openMosix mailing lists. Most of these new functionalities are already
implemented while some of them, such as DSM (Distributed Shared
Memory) are still being worked on at the moment I write this (march
2003).</P
><P
>To approach standardization and future compatibility the
proc-interface has changed from /proc/mosix to /proc/hpc and the
/etc/mosix.map was changed to /etc/hpc.map. More recently the standard
for the config file has been set to be located in /etc/openmosix.map
(this is in fact the first config file the /etc/init.d/openmosix
script will look for).  Adapted command-line user-space tools for
openMosix are already available on the web-page of the project.</P
><P
>The openmosix.map config file can be replaced with a
node-auto-discovery system which is called omdiscd (openMosix auto
DISCovery Daemon) about which we will discuss later.</P
><P
>openMosix is supported by various competent people (see
openmosix.sourceforge.net) working together around the world.  The
main goal of the project is to create a standardized
clustering-environment for all kinds of HPC-applications.</P

>2.3. openMosix in action: An example</H1
><P
>&#13; openMosix clusters can take various forms. To demonstrate this, let's
 assume you are a student and share a dorm room with a rich computer
 science guy, with whom you have linked computers to form an openMosix
 cluster.  Let's also assume you are currently converting music files
 from your CDs to Ogg Vorbis for your private use, which is legal in
 your country. Your roommate is working on a project in C++ that he
 says will bring World Peace. However, at just this moment he is in
 the bathroom doing unspeakable things, and his computer is idle.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;  So when you start a program like bladeenc  to convert Bach's 
  .... from .wav to .ogg format, the openMosix routines on your
  machine compare the load on both nodes and decide that things will
  go faster if that process is sent from your Pentium-233 to his
  Athlon XP. This happens automatically: you just type or click your
  commands as you would if you were on a standalone machine. All you
  notice is that when you start two more coding runs, things go a lot
  faster, and the response time doesn't go down.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;  Now while you're still typing ...., your roommate comes back,
  mumbling something about red chili peppers in cafeteria food. He
  resumes his tests, using a program called 'pmake', a version of
  'make' optimized for parallel execution. Whatever he's doing, it
  uses up so much CPU time that openMosix even starts to send
  subprocesses to your machine to balance the load.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;  This setup is called *single-pool*: all computers are used as a
  single cluster. The advantage/disadvantage of this is that your
  computer is part of the pool: your stuff will run on other
  computers, but their stuff will run on yours too.&#13;</P

actually runs on another machine in the cluster.  Each process has its
own Unique Home Node (UHN) where it gets created.</P
><P
>&#13;Migration means that a process is splitted in 2 parts, a user part and
a system part.  The user part will be moved to a remote node while the
system part will stay on the UHN.  This system-part is sometimes
called the deputy process: this process takes care of resolving most
of the system calls.</P

><P
> Installing a basic cluster requires at least 2 network
connected machines, either using a cross-cable between the two network
cards or using a switch or hub (a switch is much better than a hub
though and only costs a few bucks more).  Of course the faster your
network-cards the easier you will get better performance for your
cluster.</P
><P
> These days Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps) is standard; putting
multiple ports in a machine isn't that difficult, but make sure to
connect them through other physical networks in order to gain the
speed you want.  Gigabit Ethernet is getting cheaper every day now but
I suggest that you don't rush to the shop spending your money before
you have actually tested your setup with multiple 100Mbit cards and
noticed that you really do need the extra network capacity.  Next to
putting a Gigabit card you might also want to try bonding different
100Mbit cards together. An even cheaper alternative can be found in 
Firewire, as discussed in <A

do some small tests, but if you are planning to deploy a N node
cluster you will have to make sure that the environment that will hold
these machines is capable of doing so.</P

single connected or even a 1 to 1 cross connected network between all
your nodes.  You will also need to make sure that there is enough
power to support such a range of machines, that your air-conditioning
system supports the load and that in case of power-failure your UPS
can cleanly shut down all the required systems. You might want to
invest in a KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) Switch in order to facility
access to the machines' consoles.</P

such an investment, make sure that you can always easily access the

an hard-disk of a machine in trouble.  If that means that you have to
unload a stack of machines to reach the bottom one, hence shutting
down your cluster, you are in trouble.</P

>In an environment that is called a <EM

servers are a part of the cluster while workstations aren't part of
it, they don't even have openMosix kernel.  If you want to run 
applications on the cluster you will need to
specifically log on to these servers.  However your workstation will also 
stay
clean and no remote processes will migrate to it.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A third alternative is called an <EM
>Adaptive-pool</EM
>
configuration: here servers are shared while workstations join or
leave the cluster. Imagine your workstation being used during daytime
by yourself but, as soon as you log out in the evening, a script tells
the workstation to join the cluster and start crunching numbers. This
way your machine is being used while you don't need it. If you need
the resources of the machine again just run the openmosix stop script
and your processes will stay away from the cluster and vice-versa.</P

><P
> First of all, you must understand that openMosix is made up of
a kernel patch and some user-space tools. The kernel patch is needed
to make the kernel capable of talking to other openMosix-enabled
machines on the network. If you download openMosix as a binary package
(such as an rpm file), you don't even need to take care about the
kernel patch because the kernel has been patched and compiled with the
most common default options and modules for you.  </P
><P
> The user-space tools are needed in order to make an effective
use of an openMosix-enabled kernel. They are needed to start/stop the
migration daemon, the openMosix File System, to migrate jobs to
certain nodes and other tasks which are usually
accomplished with the help our good old friend: the command line
interface. About binary packages: the same as in the kernel patch goes
for the user-space tools: if you install an rpm you don't need to
care about compiling them or configuring anything; just let them install
and run. That's all. Really :) </P
><P
> Once you get to the download page (which we'll talk about in a
second), you'll need to get two distinct parts: the kernel and the
user-space tools. You can either download two binary packages or get
the kernel patch plus the user-space tools' sources. The kernel patch
is usually named after this scheme: openMosix-x.y.z-w where x.y.z is
the version of the vanilla Linux Kernel against which the patch should
be applied and w is the patch revision for that particular kernel
release. For the precompiled kernel binaries, please refer to the
README-openMosix-kernel.txt file you'll find in the download
page. This file also contains updated info about manually compiling a
kernel. </P
><P
> About the user-space tools: you'll find those in a package
named openmosix-tools. We use the terms user-space tools,
userspace-tools and openmosix-tools interchangeably.
Updated info about precompiled binaries and
manually compiling the tools are also provided in the
README-openmosix-tools.txt file. Please note that since version 0.3 of
the openmosix-tools, the openmosix.map file is deprecated and the use
of the autodiscovery daemon is highly encouraged since it tends to
make your life easier. </P

CLASS="CITETITLE"

> to compile an
openMosix kernel! Please be kind enough to download the kernel using a
mirror near to you and always try and download patches to the latest
kernel sources you do have instead of downloading the whole
thing. This is going to be much appreciated by the Linux community and
will greatly increase your geeky Karma ;-)

Be sure to use the right openMosix patch depending on the
kernel-version. At the moment I write this, the latest 2.4 kernel is
2.4.20 so you should download the openMosix-2.4.20-x.gz patch, where
the "x" stands for the patch revision (ie: the greater the revision
number, the most recent it is).

Do not use the kernel that comes with any Linux-distribution: it won't
work. These kernel sources get heavily patched by the
distribution-makers so, applying the openMosix patch to such a kernel
is going to fail for sure! Been there, done that: trust me ;-)</P
><P
>Download the actual version of the openMosix patch and move it in your
kernel-source directory (e.g. /usr/src/linux-2.4.20). If your
kernel-source directory is other than
"/usr/src/linux-[version_number]" at least the creation of a symbolic
link to "/usr/src/linux-[version_number]" is required.

Supposing you're the root user and you've downloaded the gzipped patch
file in your home directory, apply the patch using (guess what?) the
patch utility:

The "patch" command should now display a list of patched files from
the kernel-sources.

If you feel adventurous enough, enable the openMosix related options
in the kernel-configuration file, e.g.

The above means you have to choose one of "config", "menuconfig", and
"xconfig". It's a matter of taste. By the way, "config" is going to
work on any system; "menuconfig" needs the curses libraries installed
while "xconfig" needs an installed X-window environment plus the
TCL/TK libraries and interpreters.</P

>4.5. Red Hat and openMosix</H1
><P
>If you are running a RedHat 7.2, 7.3 or 8.0 version, this is probably
the easiest *Mosix install you have ever done.  Choose the appropriate
openMosix RPMs from sourceforge.  They have precompiled kernels (as I
write this 2.4.20) that work seamlessly: I have tested them on several
machines including Laptops with PCMCIA cards and Servers with SCSI
disks.  If you are a grub user, the kernel rpm even modifies your
grub.conf.  So all you have to do is install 2 RPMs:

and edit your /etc/openmosix.map if you don't wish to use the
autodiscovery daemon (omdiscd).

Since this seems to be a problem for lots of people, let's go with
another example.  Say you have 3 machines: 192.168.10.220,
192.168.10.78 and 192.168.10.84.

Your openmosix.map will look like this.

# openMosix CONFIGURATION
# ===================
#
# Each line should contain 3 fields, mapping IP addresses to openMosix node-numbers:
# 1) first openMosix node-number in range.
# 2) IP address of the above node (or node-name from /etc/hosts).
# 3) number of nodes in this range.
#
# Example: 10 machines with IP 192.168.1.50 - 192.168.1.59

Now by rebooting the different machines with the newly installed
kernel you will get one step closer to having a working cluster.</P

This means that your hostname is not listed in /etc/hosts with the

this HOWTO.</P
><P
>After rebooting with this kernel and a configured /etc/openmosix.map,
you should then have a cluster of openMosix machines that talk to
each-other and that do migration of processes.</P

In order to be able to actually use openMosixView you will need to run
it from a user who can log in to the different nodes as root.  We
suggest you set this up using ssh.  Please note that there is a
difference between the ssh and ssh2 implementations. If you do have an
identity.pub file, ssh will check authorized_keys, while if you do have
an id_dsa.pub you will need authorized_keys2!</P

><P
>The auto-discovery daemon (omdiscd) provides a way to automatically configure 
an openMosix cluster hence 
eliminating the need of a /etc/mosix.map or similar manual 
configurations.  
Auto-discovery   uses multicast packages to 
notify  other nodes that it is an openMosix node.
This way adding an extra node to your mosix cluster means that you just 
have to start the omdiscd on your machine and it will join the cluster.</P
><P
>&#13;However there are some small requirements, Like with any openMosix cluster
, you need to have networking configured correctly.  mainly the routing.  
Without a default route, you must specify an interface to omdiscd with the
-i option. Otherwise omdiscd will exit with an error like.

>PlumpOS is a CD-based GNU/Linux/openMosix mini-distribution designed
to allow users to quickly, or temporarily, add nodes to an openMosix
cluster; as I write this in march 2003 the version (release 6.9 RC1)
is a 16.7M ISO download.</P
><P
>This chapter is a quick hack up by Peter Willis of a very similar
chapter contributed by Jean-David Marrow (who is the author of
Clump/OS and inspirer of PlumpOS - props to Jean-David for his fine

>6.2. How does it work?</H1
><P
>First of all, set up your machine's BIOS in order to make it boot from
CD. Check your motherboard's manual to see how to set up this.  Upon
booting up you will receive a prompt to boot PlumpOS using a specific
kernel; several ones have been provided for you but, you also have the
option of providing your own kernel + modules. This will be explained
later in the ``Getting Started'' section. The boot menu should tell
you all the kernels available for you to use; simply type the name of
one (and optionally some kernel arguments) and press return/enter.</P
><P
>At boot-time, PlumpOS will auto-probe for network cards and, if any
gets detected, it'll try and configure them via DHCP. If successful,
it will fire up omdiscd on each interface a DHCP lease is received
on. Currently this has only been tested in PCs with 1 network card so
YMMV.</P
><P
>It works for myself, but may not work for you; if you experience
difficulties, please email me with as much information about your
system as possible -- after you have investigated the problem. (Check
the sourceforge homepage for PlumpOS's mailing list, sign up and post
your question with as much detailed information as possible. The
openMosix-general and openMosix-devel lists are NOT for PlumpOS
problems, they are for openMosix-specific problems, and if you can't
tell the difference just send it to the PlumpOS list or my contact
email).</P

that you already have a running openMosix cluster -- or perhaps only a
single openMosix node -- from which you will be initiating jobs. All
machines in the cluster must conform to the following requirements:</P

><UL
><LI
><P
>PlumpOS Machine(s) 586+ CPU</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>bootable CD-ROM drive</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Network Interface Card</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Between 32M and 128M of RAM. Because of some oddities in the openMosix
kernels at the time of this writing, simply passing the size of the
ramdisk is not working so one has to actually use a ramdisk pre-made
for a specific size. There should be several ramdisks avaliable at
PlumpOS mirrors which can be placed in the disks' root directory on
the actual cdrom ISO (or rootdisk/disks/ if you're inside the PlumpOS
package directory).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Master Machine(s) GNU/Linux/openMosix kernel (same version as all the
PlumpOS kernel you are booting on the Child/Slave PlumpOS Machine(s))</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Network Environment Running DHCP server (if you don't, or won't, run
DHCP, you can still manually configure your system: simply go to each
PlumpOS machine and enter in your desired configuration information
with the supplied networking tools. Using DHCP is highly recommended
however, and will greatly simplify your life in the long run.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The following network modules are present in most if not all of the
supplied kernels' modules tarball (in
/kernels/KERNELNAME/modules.tgz), although not all support
auto-probing; if you don't see support for your card in this list,
then PlumpOS will not work for you.</P

>Please also note that PlumpOS may not work on a laptop: it definitely
doesn't support PCMCIA cards (yet), and will probably not configure
openMosix properly if your machine contains multiple connected
Ethernet adapters.  This is a temporary limitation of the
configuration scripts, and should be resolved in future releases.</P

and enter the new directory "plumpos-6.9-rc1/". Now you have several
options as to how you go about setting up PlumpOS.</P
><P
>First let's familiarize with the directory structure here. There
should be 3 directories: 

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>rootdisk, which contains the layout of the iso to be created;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>scripts, which contains small programs used to help in the creation of
the iso;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>final, which will contain the ISO generated by the whole process.</P
></LI
></UL
>

There should also be a file called install which you will run when you
are done configuring your system.</P
><P
>If you intend on using your own kernel with PlumpOS, there are several
steps you must follow in order for it to boot properly. First you must
make a new directory in the rootdisk/kernels/ directory that will be
in the old and often blamed DoS 8.3 character format and only contain
letters and numbers (and a single '.').  In that directory you should
put a file named bzImage which is your kernel and a file named
modules.tgz which is a gzipped tarball of your kernel's modules (with
the relative path of lib/modules/ so it can be extracted from the root
dir). Optionally you can also provide the System.map and config file
for your kernel. When this is done you may simply run the install
program and it will detect and install your kernel(s) for use with the
generated ISO.</P
><P
>Now, say you want to include a 3rd party add-on package. This is done
very simply: create a gzipped tarball containing all the files you
want to include in your package (relative to "/") and put these
packages into the rootdisk/packages/ directory. Then edit the file
rootdisk/packages/list and add the path relative to / on the ramdisk
where the package can be located (in other words for a package named
"openssl.tar.gz", add the line "/cdrom/packages/openssl.tar.gz" to the
file rootdisk/packages/list). Optionally you can use a line such as
"cdrom:openssl.tar.gz" which will automatically search the cdrom's
packages directory for the package "openssl.tar.gz". In future
releases this will be useful for things like nfs and boot floppies, so
for now don't worry about it ;)</P

This is because we have set up RSA authentication between the different

either have to put the command between quotes.

><P
>(by Moshe Bar)</P
><P
>Several people have asked for a feature in openMosix which allows to 
specifiy to which nodes a given process and it's children can migrate 
and to which nodes it cannot.</P
><P
>Simone Ettore has just committed a new patch to the CVS which allows 
you to do just that.</P
><P
>Here is how it works:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>/proc/[pid]/migfilter enable/disable the capability of filter migration.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>/proc/[pid]/mignodes is a bit-list of nodes. The bit position of a node 
is calculated as 2^(PE-1). PE is node number.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>/proc/[pid]/migpolicy is the policy of the filtering:
0=DENY: the process can migrate in all nodes except when the relative
bit on mignodes is 1
1=ALLOW: the process can migrate in all nodes where the relative bit on
mignodes is 1</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>&#13;We are shortly going to release also a simple user-land tool to set the 
node mask, but I would like you guys to give it a try asap before we 
release it as openMosix 2.4.20-3.</P

you might want to have a head node from where you launch processes, this might 
be a multihomed node from where users log in to your cluster.

You want to configure your machine to make  processes
migrate away</P

>You have to trick the node in thinking it is the slowest node around and 
it'd better migrate all it's processes to the faster nodes.</P

     until you fix the problem. 

   Repeat the whole configuration scheme for a second computer. 

   The programs tune_kernel and prep_tune that Mosix uses to calibrate
     the individual nodes do not work with the SuSE distribution.
     However, you can fake it. First, bring the computer you want to
     tune and another computer with Mosix installed down to single user  
mode by typing

<TABLE

     as root. All other computers on the network should be shutdown if
     possible. 

   On both machines, run the following commands:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

        /etc/init.d/mosix start
        echo 1 &#62; /proc/mosix/admin/quiet</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

     This fakes prep_tune and the first parts of tune_kernel. Note that
     if you have a laptop with a pcmcia network card, you will have to 
     run

<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

     instead of "/etc/init.d/network start". 

   On the computer you want to tune, run tune_kernel and follow 
     instructions. Depending on your machines, this can take a while -
     if you have a dog, this might be the time to go on that long, long
     walk you've always promised him.

     tune_kernel will create a program called "pg" in /root for testing
     reasons. Ignore it. 

  After tuning is over, copy the contents of /tmp/overheads to the
     file /etc/overheads (and/or recompile the kernel). 

   Repeat the tuning procedure for each computer. Reboot, enjoy Mosix, 
and
     don't forget to brag to your friends about your new cluster.

>9.4. Channel Bonding Made Easy</H1
><P
>Contributed by  Evan Hisey</P
><P
>Channel bonding is actually horrible easy. This may explain the lack of 
documentation on this subject A bonded network appears as a normal 
network to the applications. All machines on a subnet must be bonded the same way. Bonded and non-bonded machine really don't talk well 
to each other.</P
><P
>&#13;Channel bonding needs at least two physical sub-nets but can have 
more(Currently I have a tri-bonded cluster). To enable bonding you need to 
either compile in to the kernel or as a module (bonding.o) the Channel Bonding kernel code, as of 2.4.x is it a standard option of the kernel. 
The NIC's are setup as normal with except that you only us 'ifconfig' to initialize the first card of the bond. 'ifenslave' is used to initialize 
the remaining cards in the bonded connection. 'ifenslave' can be locate in the linux/Documentation/network/ directory. It will need to be 
compiled as it is a .c file. The basic format for use is

openMosix-commands are executable by a few mouse-clicks. An advanced execution 
dialog helps to start applications on the cluster.

openMosixview is a complete rewrite "from the scratch" of Mosixview! 
It has the same functionalities but there are fundamental changes in 
ALL parts of the openMosixview source-code. It is tested with a 
constantly changing cluster topography (required for the openMosix auto-discovery) 
All "buggy" parts are removed or rewritten and it (should ;) run much more stable now. &#13;</P

(from the testers of openMosixview/Mosixview who compiled it on different 
linux-distributions, thanks again) 
Create the link /usr/lib/qt pointing to your QT-2.3.x installation 
e.g. if QT-2.3.x is installed in /usr/local/qt-2.3.0 

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ln -s /usr/local/qt-2.3.0 /usr/lib/qt </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

Then you have to set the QTDIR environment variable to 


<TABLE

or 
setenv QTDIR /usr/lib/qt (for csh) </PRE

After that the rest should work fine: 

<TABLE

><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"

then do the same in the subdirectory openmosixcollector, openmosixanalyzer, 
openmosixhistory and openmosixviewprocs. 

Copy all binaries to /usr/bin 

 
<TABLE

cp openmosixanalyzer/openmosixanalyzer/openmosixanalyzer /usr/bin 
cp openmosixhistory/openmosixhistory/openmosixhistory /usr/bin </PRE
></FONT
></TD

And the openmosixcollector init-script to your init-directory e.g.

Now copy the openmosixprocs binary on each of your cluster-nodes to /usr/bin/openmosixprocs

>&#13;You can influence the load-balancing of the whole cluster by changing these values. 
Processes in a openMosix-Cluster are migrating easier to a node with more openMosix-speed 
than to nodes with less speed. Sure it is not the physically speed you can set but it is the 
speed openMosix "thinks" a node has. 
e.g. a cpu-intensive job on a cluster-node which speed is set to the lowest value of the 
whole cluster will search for a better processor for running on and migrate 
away easily. </P

>&#13;The progress bars in the middle gives an overview of the load on each cluster-member. 
It displays in percent so it does not represent exactly the load written to the 
file /proc/hpc/nodes/x/load (by openMosix), but it should give an overview. </P

>&#13;The next progressbar is for the used memory the nodes. 
It shows the currently used memory in percent from the available memory on the hosts 
(the label to the right displays the available mem). 
How many CPUs your cluster have is written in the box to the right. 
The first line of the main windows contains a configuration button for "all-nodes". 
You can configure all nodes in your cluster similar by this option. </P

If openMosixprocs is properly installed on the remote cluster-nodes 
click the "remote proc-box"-button to open openMosixprocs (proc-box) from remote. 
xhost +hostname will be set and the display will point to your localhost. 
The client is executed on the remote also per "rsh" or "ssh". 
(the binary openmosixprocs must be copied to e.g. /usr/bin on each host of the cluster) 
openMosixprocs is a process-box for managing your programs.

Do not fork openMosixview in the background with &#38; (e.g. openMosixview &#38;). 
Maybe you cannot rsh/ssh (depends on what you want to use) as user root 
without password to each node? 
Try "rsh hostname" as root. You should not been promped for a password 
but soon get a login shell. 
(If you use SSH try "ssh hostname" as root.) 
You have to be root on the cluster because that is the only way the 
administrative commands executed by openMosixview requires root-privileges. 
openMosixview uses "rsh" as the default! 
If you only have "ssh" installed on your cluster 
edit (or create) the file /root/.openMosixview and put "1111" in it. 
This is the main-configuration 
file for openMosixview and the last "1" stands for "use ssh instead of rsh". 
This will cause openMosixview to use "ssh" even for the first start. &#13;</P

The openMosixview-client is executed per rsh 
(or ssh which you can configer whith a checkbox) 
on the remote host. It has to be installed in /usr/bin/ on each node. 
If you use RSH try: 
"xhost +hostname" 
"rsh hostname /usr/bin/openMosixview_client -display your_local_host_name:0.0" 
or if you use SSH try: 
"xhost +hostname" 
"ssh hostname /usr/bin/openMosixview_client -display your_local_host_name:0.0" 
If this works it will work in openMosixview too. 
openMosixview crashes with "segmentation fault"! 
Maybe you still use an old version of openMosixview/Mosixview ? 
in the mosix.map-parser (which is completly removed in openMosixview !!) 
(the versions openMosixview 1.2 and Mosixview &#62; 1.0 are stable) </P

(automigration on/off, blocking on/off......) 
I want them to be preselected too. 

The problem is to get the information of node. 
You have to login to each cluster-node because these information 
are not cluster-wide (to my mind). 
The status of each node is stored in the /proc/hpc/admin directory 
of each node. Everybody who knows a good way to get these information 
easy is invited to mail me.

><P
> (this HowTo is for SSH2) 


You can read the reasons why you should use SSH instead of RSH everyday 
on the newspaper when another script-kiddy hacked into an insecure system/network. 
So SSH is a good decision at all. 
<TABLE

That is why it is a bit tricky to configure SSH. SSH is secure even if you use 
it to login without being prompted for a password. 
Here is a (one) way to configure it. </P
><P
>At first a running secure-shell daemon on the remote site is required. 
If it is not already installed install it! 
(rpm -i [sshd_rpm_packeage_from_your_linux_distribution_cd]) 
If it is not already running start it with:

><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>/etc/init.d/ssh start </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

Now you have to generate a keypair for SSH on your local computer whith ssh-keygen. 

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ssh-keygen </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

You will be prompt for a passphrase for that keypair. 
The passphrase normally is longer than a password and may be a whole sentence. 
The keypair is encrypted with that passphrase and saved in 

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR

>/root/.ssh/identity    //your private key 
and 
/root/.ssh/identity.pub     //your public key </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

<EM
>Do NOT give your private-key to anybody!!! </EM
>

Now copy the whole content of /root/.ssh/identity.pub 
(your public-key which should be one long line) into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 
on the remote host. 
(also copy the content of /root/.ssh/identity.pub to 
your local /root/.ssh/authorized_keys like you did it with the remote-node 
because openMosixview needed password-less login to the local-node too!) </P
><P
>&#13;If you ssh to this remote host now you will be prompted for the passphrase 
of your public-key. Giving the right passphrase should give you a login. </P
><P
>&#13;What is the advantage right now??? 
The passphrase is normally a lot longer than a password! </P
><P
>&#13;The advantage you can get using the ssh-agent. 
It manages the passphrase during ssh login.

The ssh-agent is started now and gives you two environment-variables you should set 
(if not set already). 
Type:

to see if they are exported to your shell right now. 
If not just cut and paste from your terminal. 
e.g. for the bash-shell: 

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"

export SSH_AUTH_SOCK 
SSH_AGENT_PID=1066 
export SSH_AGENT_PID </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE

example for the csh-shell: 

<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR

COLOR="#000000"

setenv SSH_AGENT_PID 1066 </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

With these variables the remote-sshd-daemon can connect your local ssh-agent 
by using the socket-file in /tmp (in this example /tmp/ssh-XXYqbMRe/agent.1065). 
The ssh-agent can now give the passphrase to the remote host by using this socket 
(it is of course an encrypted transfer)! </P
><P
>&#13;You just have to add your public-key to the ssh-agent with the ssh-add command.

There is a menu-entry which toggles using rsh/ssh with openMosixview. 
Just enable this and you can use openMosixview even in insecure 
network-environments. You should also save this configuration 
(the possibility for saveing the current config in openMosixview 
was added in the 0.7 version) because it gets initial data from the slave 
using rsh or ssh (just like you configured). &#13;</P

Moshe Bar explains below why some processes migrate and why some don't.
But before that you can always look in /proc/$pid/, there often is a 
<EM

process can't migrate.</P

>Processes can also be locked.  
You can check if a process is locked with:

topic.&#13;</P

>Often people have the same kernel but on a different 
distribution, say a mixed environment of RedHat and Debian ,rc 
scripts from different distros tend to start openmosix 
differently.    Some implementations completely modify

Therefore all these processes have a 1 in 
/proc/pid/lock  when you start. You can force them to migrate 
by writing a 0 to this file .</P

Ok, this simple program should always migrate if launched more times than
number of local CPUs. So for a 2-way SMP system, starting this program 3
times will start migration if the other nodes in the cluster have at least
the same speed like the local ones:

>&#13;First of all , are you using the same kernel version on each machine ? 
The 'same-kernel' refers to the version. You can build different kernel 
images of the same source version to meet the hardware/software needs of a 
given node.
However you wil need toe make sure that when you install openMosix 
on your cluster, all your machines should have the openmosix-x.x.x-y 
kernel installed, in contrast to having one machine running 
openmosix-x.x.z-x, another running openmosix-x.x.x-y, another running 
openmosix x.x.x-z, and so on and so forth

that mosix is not running, see what machines show up. Do you see only your

>12.5. DFSA ? MFS ?</H1
><P
>People often get confused about what exactly MFS and DFSA 
are.  
As discussed before in the howto MFS is the feature of openMosix 
that enables you access to remote filesystems as if those 
filesystems were locally mounted.  They are mostly mounted on 
/mfs . A common misunderstanding is that you need MFS in order 
to have openMosix working, this is not true, however it can make 
things easier.  


 </P
><P
>With DFSA enabled, system calls  will be executed on the remote 
node withouth migrating the process back to it's home node. This 
behaviour (direct filesystem access) causes processes migratiing 
to the data and not the other way around (which is common).  If 
DFSA is not enabled MfS is "just" a non-caching 
network-filesystem.</P
><P
>&#13;
Very generally speaking, if you don't have DFSA turned on, each and 
every I/O will go to the home node for execution. With DFSA turned on, 
if the file happens to be residing on the node where the process finds 
itself then the I/O will happen locally.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;A very common error is that people mix kernels with DFSA enabled 
and disabled.  So one has to have a way to find out wether DFSA 
is actually enabled. This information can be obtained by typing

report the results at the end. 
Please note that this program does not take stock correlation into account. It is 
not finished yet but it's a good start. I plan to add more code at the end of the program to improve the reporting 
format of the data (generating SVG graph on the fly). But the simulation part works very well. In order to take 
advantage of the parallelism offered by openMosix, it uses the Perl module Parallel::?ForkManager (from CPAN) to 
span threads that openMosix can then assign to all the machines of the cluster (it also require another module for 
the statistical calculations, don't forget to install both, I provide the URLs in the comments of the code). Take a 
look at it and tell me what you think. Cheers!"</SPAN

perform several application + kernel tests for checking the stability and 
other features of openMosix (e.g. process migration, mfs, ...). During 
this test the cluster will be mostly loaded so you should stop other 
running applications before starting it. When it finished it generates a 
fully detailed report about each component which was tested.</P

      This will install the required perl modules and compile the 
test-programs.
      The installation of these modules requires root-privileges.
      Later you can run the openMosix stress-test also as a regular user.
      (you maybe have to delete old temporary files from root's test-runs
      in /tmp because you won't have the permission to overwrite it as 
regular user)
      You are ready to run the test now with the command:

>Ray-tracing is a rendering technique that calculates an image of a scene by simulating the way rays of 
light travel in the real world. However it does its job backwards. In the real world, rays of light are 
emitted from a light source and illuminate objects. The light reflects off of the objects or passes 
through transparent objects. This reflected light hits our eyes or perhaps a camera lens. Because the vast 
majority of rays never hit an observer, it would take forever to trace a scene. </P
><P
>These kind of applications can be easily made parrallel by using pvmpovray.
Pvmpovray expects to working on a Beowulf style cluster and spread it's load to other nodes using pvm.  
The openMosix way of doing this is the same, however we just do this on  1 machine and have 
openMosix do the load spreading work fo you ! </P

>First of all there are some known problems with this patch,  and other

with the preformatted databases you download from the internet.

Given the fact that openMosix tends to speed up MPI, adding openMosix to this 
config might even give you more power for your money, however we will have to 
do some extra research to be able to confirm this.</P

>There's not much documentation available right now for the kernel. I hope to 
write some in the coming weeks. Anyways, here's how the sources are laid out:</P
><P
>The openMosix code resides largely in hpc/ and include/hpc. There are lots of 
patches to the core kernel files everywhere, right from the arch/i386 
directories to mm/, fs/, etc. You need to read up the code which interests 
you and think that would matter for the present situation (that shouldn't be 
a problem, since you've done kernel coding).</P
><P
>here's what you should expect in each of the source files:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;hpc/badops.c: one file to handle all the bad operations: mostly return err 
codes</P

Yes. The openMosix effort already has more than 10 contributors. Unlike the Linux kernel maintenance system, Moshe Bar 
appoints official maintainers and then gives these maintainers the commit bit to the openMosix CVS source tree, similarly to 
FreeBSD.</P

Originally, openMosix was a fork of MOSIX, but it has evolved into an advanced clustering platform. The openMosix system no 
longer contains any non-GPL (i.e. MOSIX) code.</P

The RPMs and source for openMosix are available from our Downloads/Files Section. Please read the release notes first!</P

No. Just like the older MOSIX, you should not mix nodes because the protocols are subject to unannounced changes from 
version to version. In addition, every new version has bug fixes which warrant updating to the new kernels.</P

I'm trying to compile an openMosix-patched kernel. What compiler version should I use?:</P

CLASS="ANSWER"

><B

You should use gcc-2.95.3 as this is the recommended compiler for 2.4 kernels. This is a Linux kernel requirement, not just 
an openMosix requirement. However, nothing precludes you from having, on the same system, gcc-2.95.3 for kernel compiles and 
gcc-3.x for non-kernel compiles.</P
><P
>&#13;Additional notes: There are many kernel-related issues with gcc-3.x compilers. Inlining, optimization and page alignment do 
strange things to operating systems kernels. The standard Linux kernel is only guaranteed to compile and work properly with 
gcc 2.95.3.</P
><P
>&#13;However, the Red Hat gcc 2.96 compiler is 2.95 + RH patches. In this case, you should ensure you use gcc-2.96-74 or later. 
gcc-2.96-54 will not build the kernel correctly. In addition, please pay attention to compiler optimization. Anything 
greater than -O2 may not be wise. Similarly, if you choose to use gcc-2.95.x or derivatives, be sure not to use 
-fstrict-aliasing (which, depending on your version of gcc 2.95.x, may necessitate using -fno-strict-aliasing).</P

Treat an openMosix kernel just like any other kernel. The openMosix system is simply an extension to the kernel, and will be

No. It means is that if you install openMosix on your cluster, all your machines should have the openmosix-x.x.x-y kernel 
installed. You should not mix kernels which have different kernel versions, i.e. do not mix openmosix-x.x.z-x, and

What's oMFS, how do I use, and where do I get it?:</P
></DIV

CLASS="ANSWER"

The openMosix File System (oMFS) is the filesystem used by openMosix kernels. You get it by installing an openMosix kernel 
on the nodes of your cluster with oMFS enabled in the kernel-config. (It should be enabled in the openMosix RPMs by 
default.)</P
><P
>&#13;	You should also enable Direct Filesystem Access (DFSA) which allows a migrated process to execute many syscalls on the 
	remote node locally without the need to migrate it back to its home node.</P
><P
>&#13;	The use and administration of oMFS is very similar to NFS, but unlike NFS, oMFS features:

	The DFSA layer on top of oMFS makes sure to move the process to the data, instead of vice versa, whenever it makes sense.</P

DFSA stands for Direct File System Access and is an optimization. It allows remote proccesses to perform some file system 
system calls locally rather then sending them to their home node. MFS stands for Mosix File System and allows all nodes 
access to all node filesystems. DFSA runs on top of a cluster filesystem, in this case MFS.</P

When you run 'mosmon', press 't' to see the total number of machines running. Does it warn you that openMosix is not 
running?</P
><P
>&#13;If it does, then make sure your machine's IP address is included in /etc/openmosix.map. Don't use 
127.0.0.1. If you do, you will 
probably have problems with your DHCP server or your DNS nameserver.</P

They represent three stages of Mosix/openmosix growth. The file /etc/mosix.map is the orginal Mosix map name, The file 
/etc/hpc.map was an early openMosix map name (and 'hpc' is still used for the /proc files in openMosix). The current map

perfect load balancing to run simulation programs that I write in Perl. (Look at our

by the fact your machines are old. To us this is a nice feature of openMosix: you can add newer machines 
to an existing 
cluster as they become available. And you do not need to have all identical machines. That's fantastic!</P

If you intend to run VMWare under openMosix so that openMosix would load-balance several instances of that (yes, that

PlumpOS is a mini linux distribution aimed at an easy way to add nodes
to an openMosix cluster without a lot of work or even thought. The
original idea came from (and current development is inspired by)
ClumpOS, the now deceased project by Jean-David Marrow with a very
similar goal for MOSIX clusters.

><B

The first reason to use PlumpOS is to try out openMosix clusters in a
simple and convenient fashion. The second reason is to add nodes to an
existing cluster without a lot of work. PlumpOS is in no way a
replacement for enterprise clusters nor does it strive to be some kind
of super duper cluster project; it merely presents a quick and easy
way to turn your average 586+ PC into another node for your cluster.

From a developer's standpoint it's somewhat difficult but to the
common user it's quite simple: simply burn an ISO with all the
required files on it, pop it into a computer's CDROM drive, boot up
the PC (making sure there's a working network card and cable
installed) and there you have one more computer to distribute
load/forked processes to. Because it's a child/slave node, you have to
already have an openMosix box up and running to run tasks for PlumpOS
computers to process. Without a master node, PlumpOS is pretty
useless. That computer or some other network device must already be
serving DHCP addresses or you'll find yourself configuring all your
PlumpOS nodes by hand (which won't make for a happy network
administrator - but then again that's why we have junior admins ^_^).

Also, make sure you have the openMosix autodiscovery daemon (aka
omdiscd) running on your master node. The autodiscovery daemon can be
found into openMosix's userspace-tools package.

Yes, but not to worry: no halibuts were harmed in the making of the
logo. The halibut was found deceased on an ice drift after having
suffered a heart attack. Also, any resemblance the halibut may have to
another operating system's mascot of choice is purely coincidental.

>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    non-commercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</P
><P
>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P

>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H1
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</P

>2. VERBATIM COPYING</H1
><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P
><P
>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</P

>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H1
><P
>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</P

>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</P

      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</P

      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).</P

      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</P

      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</P

>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</P

      any Invariant Section.</P

>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</P
><P
>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</P
><P
>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</P

    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for

    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</P

>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</P

    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</P

>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts

    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
