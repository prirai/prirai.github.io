                        <P>&#13; When a new wireless node (WN) requests access to a LAN resource,
                            the access point (AP) asks for the WN's identity. <EM>No
                                other traffic than EAP is allowed before the WN is authenticated
                                (the <SPAN CLASS="QUOTE">"port"</SPAN> is closed).</EM>
                        </P>
                        <P>&#13; The wireless node that requests authentication is often called
                            <EM>Supplicant</EM>, although it is more correct to
                            say that the wireless node <EM>contains</EM> a
                            Supplicant. The Supplicant is responsible for responding to
                            Authenticator data that will establish its credentials. The same
                            goes for the access point; the
                            <EM>Authenticator is</EM> not the access point. Rather,
                            the access point contains an Authenticator. The Authenticator does
                            not even need to be in the access point; it can be an external
                            component.
                        </P>
                        <P>&#13; EAP, which is the protocol used for authentication, was originally
                            used for dial-up PPP. The identity was the username, and either
                            PAP or CHAP authentication [<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1994.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC1994</A>] was
                            used to check the user's password. Since the identity is sent in
                            clear (not encrypted), a malicious sniffer may learn the user's
                            identity. <SPAN CLASS="QUOTE">"Identity hiding"</SPAN> is therefore used; the
                            real identity is not sent before the encrypted TLS tunnel is up.
                        </P>
                    </LI>
                    <LI>
                        <P>&#13; After the identity has been sent, the authentication process
                            begins. The protocol used between the Supplicant and the
                            Authenticator is EAP, or, more correctly, EAP encapsulation over
                            LAN (EAPOL). The Authenticator re-encapsulates the EAP messages to
                            RADIUS format, and passes them to the Authentication Server.
                        </P>
                        <P>&#13; During authentication, the Authenticator just relays packets
                            between the Supplicant and the Authentication Server. When the
                            authentication process finishes, the Authentication Server sends a
                            success message (or failure, if the authentication
                            failed).<EM> The Authenticator then opens the
                                <SPAN CLASS="QUOTE">"port"</SPAN> for the Supplicant.</EM>
                        </P>

                    <LI>
                        <P>&#13; After a successful authentication, the Supplicant is granted
                            access to other LAN resources/Internet.

                </P>
                <P>&#13; Why is it called <SPAN CLASS="QUOTE">"port"</SPAN>-based authentication? The
                    Authenticator deals with <EM>controlled</EM> and
                    <EM>uncontrolled</EM> ports. Both the controlled and the
                    uncontrolled port are logical entities (virtual ports), but use the
                    same physical connection to the LAN (same point of attachment).

                <P>&#13; <SPAN CLASS="QUOTE">"
                        [EAP is] an authentication framework which supports multiple
                        authentication methods. EAP typically runs directly over data link
                        layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without
                        requiring IP. EAP provides its own support for duplicate
                        elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer
                        ordering guarantees. Fragmentation is not supported within EAP
                        itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this."</SPAN>

            <P>&#13; As described in <A HREF="#Key">Key Management</A>, one of
                the big advantages of using Dynamic WEP/802.11i with 802.1X is the
                support for session keys. A new encryption key is generated for each
                session.
            </P>
            <P>&#13; <SPAN CLASS="application">Xsupplicant</SPAN> only supports <SPAN CLASS="QUOTE">"Dynamic
                    WEP"</SPAN> as of this writing. Support for WPA and RSN/WPA2
                (802.11i) is being worked on, and is estimated to be supported at
                the end of the year/early next year (2004/2005), according to Chris
                Hessing (one of the <SPAN CLASS="application">Xsupplicants</SPAN>
                developers).
            </P>
            <P>&#13; Not all wireless drives support dynamic WEP, nor WPA. To use RSN
                (WPA2), new support in hardware may even be required. Many older
                drivers assume only one WEP key will be used on the network at any
                time. The card is reset whenever the key is changed to let the new
                key take effect. This triggers a new authentication, and there is a
                never-ending loop.
            </P>
            <P>&#13; At the time of writing, most of the wireless drivers in the base
                Linux kernel require patching to make dynamic WEP/WPA work. They
                will, in time, be upgraded to support these new features. Many drivers
                developed outside the kernel, however, support for dynamic WEP;
                HostAP, madwifi, Orinoco, and atmel should work without problems.
            </P>
            <P>&#13; Instead of using Xsupplicant, <A HREF="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/" TARGET="_top">wpa_supplicant</A>
                may be used. It has support for both WPA and RSN (WPA2), and a wide
                range of EAP authentication methods.

                            in this document are required. To use EAP-TLS, client certificates
                            must be used as well.

                <P>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
                    other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
                    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
                    or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
                    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
                    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
                    modifications made by others.</P>
                <P>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
                    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
                    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
                    designed for free software.</P>
                <P>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
                    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
                    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
                    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
                    can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
                    whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
                    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P>

                <H1 CLASS="section"><A NAME="gfdl-1"></A>A.2. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H1>
                <P>This License applies to any manual or other work, in
                    any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
                    it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice
                    grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
                    that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below,
                    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
                    licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you
                    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
                    copyright law.</P>
                <P>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
                    work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
                    or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</P>
                <P>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or
                    a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
                    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
                    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
                    that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the
                    Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may
                    not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of
                    historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
                    legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
                    regarding them.</P>
                <P>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary
                    Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
                    Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under
                    this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of
                    Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The
                    Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not
                    identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</P>
                <P>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of
                    text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
                    notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A
                    Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at
                    most 25 words.</P>
                <P>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
                    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
                    available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
                    document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
                    composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
                    available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
                    formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
                    for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
                    file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
                    thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
                    Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
                    substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
                    "Opaque".</P>
                <P>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
                    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
                    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
                    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
                    transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
                    include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
                    proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
                    processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
                    HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
                    purposes only.</P>
                <P>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book,
                    the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
                    legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
                    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
                    Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
                    title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</P>
                <P>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
                    of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
                    parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.
                    (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
                    "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To
                    "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document
                    means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this
                    definition.</P>
                <P>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
                    which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
                    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
                    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
                    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
                    meaning of this License.</P>

                    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
                    the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
                    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
                    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
                    of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
                    compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
                    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
                </P>
                <P>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,

                <P>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
                    have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
                    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
                    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
                    Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
                    cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
                    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
                    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
                    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
                    to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
                    satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
                    respects.</P>
                <P>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
                    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
                    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
                    pages.</P>
                <P>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
                    numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
                    Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
                    Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
                    network-using public has access to download using public-standard
                    network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
                    added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
                    prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
                    to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
                    stated location until at least one year after the last time you
                    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
                    of that edition to the public.</P>
                <P>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
                    the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
                    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the

                    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
                    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</P>
                <P>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it

                    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
                    arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes
                    a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
                    arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may
                    not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission

                    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
                    at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
                    publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
