<P> This document describes how we set up our Linux computing clusters
for high-performance computing which we need for 
<A HREF="http://compbio.washington.edu">our research</A>. </P>
<P> Use the information below at your own risk.  I disclaim all
responsibility for anything you may do after reading this HOWTO. The
latest version of this HOWTO will always be available at 
<A HREF="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/linux_cluster.html">http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/linux_cluster.html</A>. </P>
<P> Unlike other documentation that talks about setting up clusters in
a general way, this is a specific description of how our lab is setup
and includes not only details the compute aspects, but also the
desktop, laptop, and public server aspects.  This is done mainly for
local use, but I put it up on the web since I received several e-mail
messages based on my newsgroup query requesting the same information.
Even today, as I plan another 64-node cluster, I find that there is a
dearth of information about exactly how to assemble components to form
a node that works reliably under Linux that includes information not
only about the compute nodes, but about hardware that needs to work
well with the nodes for productive research to happen.  The main use
of this HOWTO as it stands is that it's a report on what kind of
hardware works well with Linux and what kind of hardware doesn't. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc2.3">Desktop and terminal hardware</A>
</H2>

<P> We have identified at least two kinds of users of our cluster:
those that need (i.e., take advantage of) permanent local processing
power and disk space in conjunction with the cluster to speed up
processing, and those that just need only the cluster processing
power. The former are assigned "desktops" which are essentially
high-performance machines, and the latter are assigned dumb
"terminals". Our desktops are usually dual or quad processor machines
with the current high-end CPU being a 1.6 GHz Opteron, having as much
as 10 GB of RAM, and over 1 TB of local disk space. Our terminals are
essentially machines where a user can log in and then run jobs on our
farm.  In this setup, people may also use laptops as dumb terminals. </P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc2.4">Miscellaneous/accessory hardware</A>
</H2>

<P> We generally use/prefer Viewsonic monitors, Microsoft Intellimouse
mice, and Microsoft Natural keyboards. These generally have worked
quite reliably for us. </P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc2.5">Putting-it-all-together hardware</A>
</H2>

<P> For visual access to the nodes, we initially used to use KVM
switches with a cheap monitor to connect up and "look" at all the
machines.  While this was a nice solution, it did not scale. We
currently wheel a small monitor around and hook up cables as needed.
What we need is a small hand held monitor that can plug into the back
of the PC (operated with a stylus, like the Palm). </P>
<P> For networking, we generally use Netgear and Cisco switches. </P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc2.6">Costs</A>
</H2>

<P> Our vendor is Hard Drives Northwest (
<A HREF="http://www.hdnw.com">http://www.hdnw.com</A>). For each
compute node in our cluster (containing two processors), we paid about
$1500-$2000, including taxes. Generally, our goal is to keep the cost
of each processor to below $1000 (including housing it). </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">Operating system: Linux, of course!</A>
</H2>

<P> The following kernels and distributions are what are being used:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Kernel 2.2.16-22, distribution KRUD 7.0</LI>
<LI> Kernel 2.4.9-7, distribution KRUD 7.2</LI>
<LI> Kernel 2.4.18-10, distribution KRUD 7.3</LI>
<LI> Kernel 2.4.20-13.9, distribution KRUD 9.0</LI>
<LI> Kernel 2.4.22-1.2188, distribution KRUD 2004-05</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>These distributions work very well for us since updates are sent to us
on CD and there's no reliance on an external network connection for
updates. They also seem "cleaner" than the regular Red Hat
distributions, and the setup is extremely stable. </P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc3.2">Networking software</A>
</H2>

<P> We use Shorewall 1.3.14a ((

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc3.3">Parallel processing software</A>

<P> We use our own software for parallelising applications but have
experimented with 
<A HREF="http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">PVM</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/">MPI</A>. In my view, the overhead for these pre-packaged programs
is too high.  I recommend writing application-specific code for the
tasks you perform (that's one person's view). </P>

</H2>

<P> This section describes disk partitioning strategies. Our goal is
to keep the virtual structures of the machines organised such that
they are all logical. We're finding that the physical mappings to the
logical structures are not sustainable as hardware and software
(operating system) change. Currently, our strategy is as follows: </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

farm/cluster machines:

partition 1 on system disk     - swap  (2 * RAM)
partition 2 on system disk     - /     (remaining disk space)
partition 1 on additional disk - /maxa (total disk)

servers:

partition 1 on system disk        - swap  (2 * RAM)

partition 1 on additional disk 5  - /maxe (total disk)
partition 1 on additional disk 6  - /maxf (total disk)

desktops:

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc4.3">Operating system installation and maintenance</A>
</H2>

<H3>Personal cloning strategy</H3>

<P> I believe in having a completely distributed system. This means
each machine contains a copy of the operating system.  Installing the
OS on each machine manually is cumbersome. To optimise this process,
what I do is first set up and install one machine exactly the way I
want to.  I then create a tar and gzipped file of the entire system
and place it on a bootable CD-ROM which I then clone on each machine
in my cluster. </P>
<P> The commands I use to create the tar file are as follows: </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -czvlps --same-owner --atime-preserve -f /maxa/slash.tgz /
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P> I use a script called <CODE>go</CODE> that takes a machine
number as its argument and untars the <CODE>slash.tgz</CODE> file on the
CD-ROM and replaces the hostname and IP address in the appropriate
locations. A version of the <CODE>go</CODE> script and the input files for
it can be accessed at: 
<A HREF="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/cluster/">http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/linux/cluster/</A>. This script
will have to be edited based on your cluster design. </P>
<P> To make this work, I use Martin Purschke's Custom Rescue Disk
(
<A HREF="http://www.phenix.bnl.gov/~purschke/RescueCD/">http://www.phenix.bnl.gov/~purschke/RescueCD/</A>) to create a
bootable CD image containing the .tgz file representing the cloned
system, as well as the <CODE>go</CODE> script and other associated files.
This is burned onto a CD-ROM. </P>
<P> There are several documents that describe how to create your own
custom bootable CD, including the Linux Bootdisk HOWTO (
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/</A>), which also
contains links to other pre-made boot/root disks. </P>
<P> Thus you have a system where all you have to do is insert a CDROM,
turn on the machine, have a cup of coffee (or a can of coke) and come
back to see a full clone. You then repeat this process for as many
machines as you have. This procedure has worked extremely well for me
and if you have someone else actually doing the work (of inserting and
removing CD-ROMs) then it's ideal. In my system, I specify the IP
address by specifying the number of the machine, but this could be
completely automated through the use of DHCP. </P>
<P> Rob Fantini (
<A HREF="mailto:rob@fantinibakery.com">rob@fantinibakery.com</A>) has contributed modifications of the
scripts above that he used for cloning a Mandrake 8.2 system
accessible at 
<A HREF="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/cluster/fantini_contribution.tgz">http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/cluster/fantini_contribution.tgz</A>.</P>
<H3>Cloning and maintenance packages</H3>

<H3>FAI </H3>

<P> FAI (
<A HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/</A>) is an automated
system to install a Debian GNU/Linux operating system on a PC
cluster. You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and
after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on the
whole cluster, without any interaction necessary.</P>

<H3>SystemImager </H3>

<P> SystemImager (
<A HREF="http://systemimager.org">http://systemimager.org</A>) is software that automates Linux
installs, software distribution, and production deployment. </P>
<H3>DHCP vs. hard-coded IP addresses</H3>

<P> If you have DHCP set up, then you don't need to reset the IP
address and that part of it can be removed from the <CODE>go</CODE>
script. </P>
<P> DHCP has the advantage that you don't muck around with IP
addresses at all provided the DHCP server is configured
appropriately. It has the disadvantage that it relies on a centralised
server (and like I said, I tend to distribute things as much as
possible). Also, linking hardware ethernet addresses to IP addresses can
make it inconvenient if you wish to replace machines or change
hostnames routinely. </P>
<H2><A NAME="known_hardware_issues"></A> <A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc4.4">Known hardware issues </A>
</H2>

<P> The hardware in general has worked really well for us. Specific
issues are listed below: </P>
<P> The AMD dual 1.2 GHz machines run really hot. Two of them in a
room increase the temperature significantly. Thus while they might be
okay as desktops, the cooling and power consumption when using them as
part of a large cluster is a consideration. The AMD Palmino
configuration described previously seems to work really well, but I
definitely recommend getting two fans in the case--this solved all our
instability problems. </P>
<H2><A NAME="known_software_issues"></A> <A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc4.5">Known software issues </A>
</H2>

<P> Some tar executables apparently don't create a tar file the nice
way they're supposed to (especially in terms of referencing and
de-referencing symbolic links). The solution to this I've found is to
use a tar executable that does, like the one from RedHat 7.0. </P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s5">5.</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc5">Performing tasks on the cluster</A></H2>

<P> This section is still being developed as the usage on my cluster
evolves, but so far we tend to write our own sets of message passing
routines to communicate between processes on different machines.  </P>
<P> Many applications, particularly in the computational genomics
areas, are massively and trivially parallelisable, meaning that
perfect distribution can be achieved by spreading tasks equally across
the machines (for example, when analysing a whole genome using a
technique that operates on a single gene/protein, each processor can
work on one gene/protein at a time independent of all the other
processors). </P>
<P> So far we have not found the need to use a professional queueing
system, but obviously that is highly dependent on the type of
applications you wish to run. </P>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P> Yes, the Athlon 1.5 GHz is faster than the Xeon 1.7 GHz since the
Xeon executes only six instructions per clock (IPC) whereas the Athlon
executes nine IPC (you do the math!). This is however an highly
non-rigourous comparison since the executables were each compiled on
the machines (so the quality of the math libraries for example will
have an impact) and the supporting hardware is different. </P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="Cluster-HOWTO.html#toc5.2">Uptimes</A>

<P> These machines are incredibly stable both in terms of hardware and
software once they have been debugged (usually some in a new batch of
machines have hardware problems), running constantly under very heavy
loads.  One common example is given below. Reboots have generally
occurred when a circuit breaker is tripped.</P>
