HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System"
TARGET="_top"
>X Window System</A
> is the display and networking protocol 
     developed by MIT.  The X is built with network in mind with the capability to run a (graphical) session on a remote computer.
     In it, an X Display Manager is used to start a session from a local system or from another computer.  The request and the start 
     of the session is handled by the XDMCP, which stands for "X Display Manager Control Protocol" and is a network protocol. 
     It provides a way of running the X-Terminal to run on your PC (or MAC) and it uses the X Server to provide a client/server 
     interface between display hardware (the mouse, keyboard, and video displays) and the desktop environment while also providing 
     both the windowing infrastructure and a standardized application interface (quoted from XFree86 Project home page).  
     The X-Terminal can be displayed with an individual window or multiple windows, based on your X window system's software capabilities and setup.
  </P
><P
>     I am always looking for the best way to use Linux, both at home and in work.  One of the biggest advantages among all is the ability to re-use the 
     older systems (like Pentium, Pentium II, Pentium III and even the 486 and AMD x86 CPUs) as a Xterminal (by using the Win32 apps; 
     like Hummingbird's Exceed, Reflection X, X-Win32 or X-ThinPro.  For MAC, try eXodus) to run 
     from any of your PC remotely. 
     I found out, somehow very surprising, that there are many documents on the INTERNET that can help you to set it up, 
     but not with a step by step HOW-TO format!  
     This is how I came up with this document as a way to share my experiences with all users.  By using X and XDMCP, 
     you can build a good, reliable and low cost X- environment for your home or work IT solution.  Best of all, it is free!
     You will also find out that those long abandoned PC by the current Windows system can run the X in Linux just fine!  
     It can save you money and spare the mother earth!
  </P
><P
>     In recent years, new Linux distributions are getting easier to use by adding new user UI.  However, I still believe much in manual
     control of the system and application if I can, because in this way, I know what I am going to change in my system in the way
     I wanted it.  Therefore, I will focus this document on manual configuration.

>     Before you begin, it is better to have a basic understanding of how this works.  The X server is usually started from the X Display Manager (DM).  
     In this <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager"
TARGET="_top"
>X DM Wiki</A
> page, it gives you a basic understanding of 
     how it works!   (More details are at the <A
HREF="#REFS"
TARGET="_top"

> below and  
     <A
HREF="http://www.tldp.org"

>LDP HOWTO page</A
>)</P
><P
>  Almost all the Linux distributions include the xdm, kdm and gdm to you as your choices.  (This document will use gdm and kdm as an example). 
  The Display Manager provides a nice and consistent interfaces for general users (X-based login, starting up a window manager, clock, etc.).  
  X Display Manager manages a collection of X displays, which may be on the local host or remote servers.  It is worth noting that 
  the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Xsession</B
> file is what  runs your environment.</P
><P
>  When xdm runs, it offers display management in two different ways. It can manage X Server running on the local machine and specified in "Xservers", 
  and/or it can manage remote X Servers (typically Xterminals) using XDMCP as specified in the "Xaccess" file.  (refer to the xdm man page).</P
><P
>  For kdm (which comes with the KDE desktop), it is a replacement of xdm and configures the same way, except its files are in 
  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/X11/kdm</TT
> in Caldera/SCO, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/kde/kdm</TT
> in Red Hat (and Fedora Core) and 
  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/share/config/kdm</TT
>, which is a symbolic link to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/kde/kdm</TT
>, in Mandrake. </P
><P
>  The gdm (Gnome Display Manager) is a re-implementation of the well known xdm. gdm has similar functions to xdm and kdm, 
  gdm is the Gnome Display Manager, and its configuration files are found in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</TT
>. 
  The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdm.conf</TT
> file contains sets of variables and many options for gdm, and the Sessions directory 
  contains a script for each session option; each script calls <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</TT
> with the appropriate option.
  gdm has similar functions to xdm and kdm, but was written from scratch and does not contain any original XDM / X Consortium code. </P
><P
>  RH 8.0 introduces the new graphical interface called "Bluecurve".  The new interface is aimed for XP feel and styles.  The setup makes
  no difference in this case!</P

><P
>     You need to bare this in mind that both X and XDMCP is inherently insecure, and that's why many of the distributions shipped 
     as it's XDMCP default turned off. If you must use XDMCP, be sure to use it only in a trusted networks, such as corporate network 
     within a firewall. Never use it in the open network (or Internet) environment without a firewall protection! 
     If you are using at home, remember to add a firewall equipped router for protection.  </P

>     XDMCP connection opens up UDP ports; therefore, it is not natively able to use it with SSH. Currently, SSH1 and SSH2 are not implemented 
     to securely forward the UDP communication. To secure the connection with SSH, the technique is called X11 TCP/IP Port Forwarding.

     The other I have tried on is Caldera eDesktop 2.4 (now owned by SCO), which is similar to RH's setup, except that it uses KDE.  
     I have not had a chance to test it on other Linux flavors like Debian, Turbolinux, Gentoo, etc. However, the setup should be 
     similar and should work just fine. If you have successfully setup one other than the distribution listed above, 
     please share it with me. I will add them into this document.

CLASS="COMMAND"

     Linux workstation or server name(s) in the "<TT

     If you are only use it in the lab or at home, then, you can add the 
     host name of all workstations in your local static hosts table in "<TT

         If you plan to use SSH Port Forwarding, you need to install the OpenSSH package or compile SSH with your kernel.  
	 Also, most dists now come with firewall installed by default (unless you choose not to).  You may encounter problem, 
	 if you do not add firewall rules or temporary disable it in setting up XDMCP.  I will not cover the firewall rules here in details,

>3. X11 Forwarding using SSH</H1
><P
>     As I have explained earlier, using XDMCP to display X across Internet is basically a no-no, due to it's lack of
     encryption across the Internet.  One way to enforce the traffic security is to use the SSH by the way of 
     X11 tunnelling or port forwarding.  SSH (Secure Shell) is developed in 1995 by Tatu Ylonen to replace the insecure telnet, ftp,
     scp, rcp, rlogin, rsh, etc.  The first thing you need to know is that X11 forwarding using SSH is different from 
     your regular, non-secure way of running X Window.
  </P
><P
>  
    To start this setup, you need an additional piece of information.  First, you must have your SSH package installed.
    In Linux, they are the OpenSSH packages.  Check your distribution to decide what package you need to install (some installed it
    as standard packages).  Secondly, you need a Windows SSH Client (other OS version, like MAC, are also available).  
    I recommend PuTTY.  It is a wonderful free SSH client and   you can download them from 
    <A
HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"
TARGET="_top"
>this link</A
>.  Remember to download the document and read
    them carefully.  The other good free SSH clients are: Tera Term Pro + TTSSH: An SSH Extension to Tera Term, SSH Secure Shell
    Client by SSH.com (only free for non-commercial use).  I will break down again into steps, so it is easy for you to follow.

	 find the Connection tree.  In SSH, expand it and you will see Tunnels window.  Click "Enable X11 forwarding".  It is setting the
	 default to X display at "localhost:0".  Now, go back to Session and save this session with a name you like.  I normally use the

>  In the example of Hummingbird Exceed, this is what you need to do.  (For other X client, the setup is similar).
	 Open up the Xconfig from your Exceed folder.  In your "Screen Definition", change to "Multiple" Window mode and save it.
	 Next, open up your "Communication" icon and set the Startup mode to "Passive".

>  Now you are done.  To test it, first using PuTTY (or other SSH client) to connect to your server.  The first time
	 connection, it will ask you whether you want to cache the Security Key or not.  (Yes is normal choice).  Once log in is done,
	 fire up your Exceed.  It will stay in the background.  Now you can execute any of your X application and it should forward the
	 X application via SSH to your local screen.  For example:

     Now you see the difference is that you do not see all your X Window.  You are simply running X application one by one and
     forwarding via SSH to your local screen.  Therefore, you need to know the command for running each X application.  All the
     control are done via SSH client window.  To me, the security is worthy than the slightly inconvenience!
   </P

     Hummingbird Exceed's newer version now support the SSH connection.  I am sure other X application may be able to do the same in their

  </P
><P
>        GDM also supports the X Display Manager Protocol (XDMCP) for managing remote displays. GDM listens to UDP port 177 and will respond to QUERY and
BROADCAST_QUERY requests by sending a WILLING packet to the originator.  GDM can also be configured to honor INDIRECT queries and present a host chooser 
to the remote display. GDM will remember the user's choice and forward subsequent requests to the chosen manager.  GDM only supports the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 
authentication system. Little is gained from the other schemes, and no effort has been made to implement them so far.  Since it is fairly easy to do denial 
of service attacks on the XDMCP service, GDM incorporates a few features to guard against attacks. Please read the XDMCP reference section below 
for more information.
      </P
><P
>        Even though GDM tries to outsmart potential attackers, it is still advised that you block UDP port 177 on your firewall unless you really need it. GDM guards against DoS attacks, but the X protocol is still inherently insecure and should only be used in controlled environments.  Even though your display is protected by cookies the XEvents and thus the keystrokes typed when entering passwords will still go over the wire in clear text. It is trivial to capture these. You should also be aware that cookies, if placed on an NFS mounted directory, are prone to eavesdropping too.
