>1. Introduction</H1
><P
>&#13; The <EM
>X Window System</EM
> is an advanced, graphical
 computing and network environment that was designed from the ground up as a
 multi-user system. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> was first released in 1984.
 If you are not familiar with the basic concepts surrounding
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> and it's related components, you should first
 read the <I
CLASS="citetitle"
>X Window System Architecture Overview HOWTO</I
>, <A
HREF="http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XWindow-Overview-HOWTO/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XWindow-Overview-HOWTO/index.html</A
>,
 to get an idea of how the various pieces fit together. There is also 
 an attempt to define to various <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> related
 terminology in the <A
HREF="#terms"
>Appendix</A
>, if concepts such 
 as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"displays"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X clients"</SPAN
> in this context are
 confusing to you.

</P
><P
>&#13; This document will address basic X Window configuration and usage on Linux. We will
 also look at how <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is commonly started in Linux,
 and how the start up can be configured, and related issues. We will
 <EM
>not</EM
> examine Window Manager (e.g.
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>fvwm</SPAN
>), or Desktop Environment
 (<SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
>)
 configuration. There are just too many variables there, and the pace of
 change moves too quickly. Of course, to a large extent the user interacts
 more directly with these components than the X server itself, so additional
 reading would be worthwhile. Check your locally installed documentation, and
 the respective home pages for more information.

</P
><P
>&#13; Some other important points to remember here:

</P
><P
>&#13; <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is a client-server, multi-user system in
    every respect, and not just a GUI.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is not integrated into the operating system,
   and rides on top of it, like other servers.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is an open standard, and runs on many platforms. 
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    What you actually see on the screen is the result of various components,
    all working together: operating system, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>,
    Window Manager, and optionally, a desktop environment like
    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
>. These
    are all <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"plug and play"</SPAN
> components, meaning you can
    interchange an individual component without touching the other components.
    
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    Each of the various components has its own configuration. This makes for a
    very flexible, and potentially very robust, system. It also adds 
    complexity.
  </P
></LI
></UL
>
</P
><P
>&#13; The discussion here will be limited to <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> as
 implemented by <A
HREF="http://xfree86.org"
TARGET="_top"
>The XFree86 Project,
 Inc.</A
> on Linux. There are other implementations, including
 commercial ones. XFree86 v4.x has been out for some time now, so we will be
 assuming that version. Much of the discussion applies to the previous 3.x
 version as well, but there are some occasional differences.

</P
><P
>&#13; It is also worth noting that there are conceivably many ways to start
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>, and to set up a Linux system. We will focus on
 the common methods found in Linux distributions. Also, vendors may vary on
 where they put configuration files, and how they name them. Keep this in mind
 if you see such discrepancies in this document. If this is a problem, your
 vendor surely has their own documentation. And as always, hopefully the man
 pages will conform to your installation.

</P
><P
>&#13; Also, we will look at various configuration files in the following sections.
 These are all plain text files, and can be edited with your favorite editor.
 Always make a backup copy before editing important files, in case Murphy pays
 a visit (e.g. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"cp /etc/X11/XF86Config-4  /etc/X11/XF86Config-4.bak"</SPAN
>).

may be found at the Linux Documentation Project.
</P

 to <A
HREF="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.plig.org/xwinman/</A
>
 as a good resource for shopping Window Managers. Add link for fluxbox, 
 a Window Manager with Tabbed windows. And add a brief section on improving 
 network performance. Verify links all work.
</P
><P
>&#13; v3.0: This is a major rewrite with several new sections. Some
 sections were removed, with the focus more now on just
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> itself (and not clients like Window Managers).
 New maintainer too :-)
</P
><P
>&#13; v2.0: includes corrections from Guus Bosch, Brian J.
 Miller, and myself, as well as lots of new updates and info.
</P
><P
>&#13; v1.4: include corrections and additions from Anthony J., and
 some very good security tips from Tomasz Motylewski.

>&#13; I have assumed maintainership of this document because it was abandoned, and
 I had wanted to offer a suggested change. Well, to make a long story short,
 this led to a major re-write. You can help make this a better document by
 correcting inaccuracies, clarifying the unclear, and suggesting improvements.
 There is much about this topic I may not know, or not have explained well. Your
 help will improve this document and help other users. This document 
 <EM

>&#13; The X server controls both input (keyboard, mouse, etc) and output (display,
 monitor) devices.

</P
><P
>&#13; Compatible hardware is a tough topic, since it is very much a moving target.
 We are forced here to avoid specifics, since this would surely change by the
 time you read this. And would be tediously lengthy anyway.

</P
><P
>&#13; So let's settle for some generalities. <EM
>Most</EM
> PC type
 hardware is supported to one degree or another. Big help ;-)

</P
><P
>&#13; Rule of thumb: if it is a device that uses a long-standing, commonplace
 protocol (e.g. PS/2), it should be well supported. Conversely, if it is
 something relatively new, with  ground-breaking technology, the odds 
 are not as good. This is just the nature of the beast with open source 
 development versus manufacturers that cater more to the most popular
 platforms. Some manufacturers are more co-operative than others too.

</P
><P
>&#13; Now, some general guidelines:

</P
><P
>&#13; <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;     Monitors - This is easy. Linux does not really need to be compatible with
     the monitor per se. That is the job of the video card. Any monitor that
     your graphics card can drive should do fine. Including, flat panel 
     monitors.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;     Video cards - This is much tougher. The X server is determined by the 
     the chipset. Many, many are supported. But inevitably there are always 
     some newer cards, or even revised cards, that are not. And some may have
     better support and better optimization than others. Advanced
     features such as multi-headed displays, 3D, TV out, DRI, etc., have some
     support as well, though this should be researched first, as the support
     may be limited. Supported cards are listed: <A
HREF="http://xfree86.org/cardlist.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://xfree86.org/cardlist.html</A
>.

   </P
><P
>&#13;     Open source drivers are often developed incrementally. For instance, a
     particular card may work well for basic display purposes, but specialized 
     features such as 3D may come much later in the development cycle. This
     is a quite different development model than with proprietary drivers from 
     the manufacturer.

   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    Keyboards -- Any standard PC type keyboard should do fine,
    including PS/2, USB and many infra-red devices. Probably many 
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"non-standard"</SPAN
> ones too ;-)

   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    Mice and other pointer devices -- Most should be supported including 
    PS/2, bus, serial, USB and many infra-red devices. Optical mice also. Unix
    has long preferred three button mice, though more buttons is supported as
    well. Many wheeled mice have X server support via the
    <SPAN

    may require supplemental configuration for some individual applications.

>&#13; Yours may look quite different. This is just one possible configuration with
 gratuitous comments from Red Hat (and me), and is for a fairly ordinary set
 up. There is nothing exotic here like multiple screens or displays.

</P

>&#13; It is beyond the scope of this document to explain this in detail. See the 
 <TT

>&#13; Just one quick note on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Screen"</SPAN
> section above. Notice there are
 three sub-sections, identified as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Display"</SPAN
>. Each sub-section
 has a different <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Depth"</SPAN
> specified, (a.k.a. ColorDepth). The
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Modes"</SPAN
> also vary somewhat according to the respective
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Depth"</SPAN
> setting. The active <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Display"</SPAN
> sub-section
 that will be used, is determined by the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"DefaultDepth"</SPAN
> setting 
 (unless over-ridden by command line options). The default in this example is
 defined as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"24"</SPAN
>, so the first sub-section will be used. Also,
 the highest <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Mode"</SPAN
> listed in this sub-section will be the default
 mode (resolution), which here is the first one listed. The first listed mode 
 also determines the viewable screen area, which can be smaller than the mode
 (resolution) itself. In which case, you would have a virtual desktop that is
 larger than the viewable screen. To have the viewable screen, and resolution 
 match, have the largest value as the first value listed for each
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Mode"</SPAN
>.

</P
><P
>&#13; Another note on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Modes"</SPAN
> here: what you see is the result of
 my choices during Red Hat's <B
CLASS="command"
>Xconfigurator's</B
> configuration. These 
 are standard resolutions, but do not have to be! This is only limited by what
 your hardware can support. And you don't have to use standard width x height 
 ratios either. Something like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1355x1112</TT
> is a valid setting (if
 your hardware supports it and it floats your boat!).

</P
><P
>&#13; The X server will reject any <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 can cycle through valid modes to change screen resolution with
 <TT
CLASS="literal"

> and <TT
CLASS="literal"

 keypad plus and minus keys).

</P

 This sometimes required hand editing to get optimal values in earlier versions of

>&#13; If whatever configuration utility you are using, does not automatically
 recognize your video card or monitor specifications correctly, you are
 unlikely to get an optimal configuration. In such cases, you may have to
 manually supply the correct values. This should be available from your

 <B

 sliders and buttons that allow user input and adjustment. The top part has
 horizontal monitor settings on the left, and vertical settings on the right.

 two default configuration files to help set up the

 checks the user's home directory for similar files, which will take
 precedence if found. Note that the latter are Unix style <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dot"</SPAN

 (e.g. <TT
CLASS="filename"
>~/.xinitrc</TT

</P
><P
>&#13; You normally would not want to edit the system wide files, but you can freely
 copy these to your home directory as a starting point, or just start from
 scratch. As you can tell by the names, one helps set up the X server, and one
 sets up <B
CLASS="command"
>xinit</B

 environment and possibly starting client programs like
 <B

>&#13; Briefly, what this script does, is set up our working environment, with
 <B
CLASS="command"

>xrdb</B

 (application resource settings). More on these below.  Then the shell variable
 <TT
CLASS="literal"
>$BROWSER</TT

 example) so that any applications that might expect this, have a reasonable
 choice available. Then the presence of the file <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Xclients</TT
>
 is checked, both as a system wide file and in the user's home directory. In
 this particular example, this is where any client applications are to be
 started, including a Window Manager (see below). These could just have as
 easily been started here if we had wanted to. If an
 <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Xclients</TT

 started for us. Either <B
CLASS="command"
>fvwm</B

 minimalist <B
CLASS="command"

 these can be started, the script would exit, and <SPAN

>&#13; This really isn't so different than what <TT
CLASS="filename"
>xinitrc</TT
> was
 doing at all. We added a few wrinkles, including starting a screen saver, a
 different terminal emulator that this user prefers (<B
CLASS="command"
>rxvt</B
>),
 with even more setting up of the environment (monitor, mouse and keyboard) using
 <B
CLASS="command"
>xset</B
> this time, and a different Window Manager than was
 available with the system defaults. This is in the user's home directory, so
 it will not be overwritten during upgrades too.

</P
><P
>&#13; Actually, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> has already started at this point, and
 we are just putting the finishing touches on the configuration. Notice the
 Window Managers are not <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"backgrounded"</SPAN
> with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#38;"</SPAN
>
 here. This is important! Something has to run in the foreground, or
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> will exit. We didn't start a desktop environment
 in this example, like <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> or
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
>, but if we did, this final application
 would have to be <B
CLASS="command"
>gnome-session</B
> or
 <B
CLASS="command"
>startkde</B
> instead. Since we are rolling our own here, if we
 wanted to change Window Managers, all we have to do is edit this file, and
 restart <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>. Vendor supplied configurations may be
 more complex than this, but the same principles apply.

</P
><P
>&#13; As an afterword, do not think that any initial client applications
 <EM
>must</EM

 been traditionally done, and some may prefer this approach. Most window
 managers have their own built-in ways to start initial programs, as do 
 <SPAN

> and <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
>. See 
 the respective documentation.

 <SPAN

 help of a <SPAN

>&#13; Before taking a look at various configuration mechanisms for X servers and
 clients, it should be noted that the advent of Desktop Environments like 
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> have become popular in part because they can
 control much of the user interaction configuration themselves with nice, 
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"user friendly"</SPAN
> GUI controls. And in fact,
 the compliant applications that are part of the respective Desktops will be
 best configured through the Desktop's configuration tools, or the
 application's own GUI configuration methods. So, for instance,
 <B
CLASS="command"
>gtop</B
>, a <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
> client
 application, is best configured via <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN

NAME="xresources"

>4.1. X Resources</H2
><P
>&#13; The X server can store various configuration values for client programs
 so they are readily available when needed. If the application supports this,
 it will use these as defaults whenever that program is invoked. These are
 known as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Resources"</SPAN
>, and are often used to define user preferences
 on a per application basis for fonts, colors, screen placement (geometry) and
 various other attributes. This makes it easy to customize applications.

</P
><P
>&#13; Resources are specified as text strings (e.g. Netscape*blinkingEnabled:
 False) that can be read from disk in various places when
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is starting, or even interactively defined on the
 command line. Program components are named in a hierarchical fashion, with
 each object in the hierarchy identified by a class as well as an instance
 name. At the top level of the hierarchy is the class and instance name of the
 application itself. Typically, the class name of the application is the
 same as the program name, but with the first letter capitalized (e.g.  Vim or
 Emacs) although some programs that begin with the letter <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X"</SPAN
>
 also capitalize the second letter for historical reasons (e.g. XTerm). 
 Each definition  will specify a class (or instance), with corresponding
 resource and value. Below this in the hierarchy are the various attributes
 that make up the definable aspects of the application. 

</P
><P
>&#13; Traditionally, most <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> programs were  configured
 this way. This is not as true today with the advent of Desktop Environments
 which often have their own configuration mechanisms.

</P
><P
>&#13; As an example, say we prefer to run <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
> with a blue
 background. So if we run it from the command line, we would run it as:

</P
><P
>&#13; If this is our preference, it would be easier to put this preference in a
 file somewhere, and have the system use our preference. That way whenever we
 started <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B

 wouldn't need the command line options (unless as an override).

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"."</SPAN

 <SPAN

 in the hierarchy. Also, the application must support the particular widget 
 attribute. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Background"</SPAN

 applications will have more specialized resources that are not so obvious. It
 is best to check local documentation (man pages, etc), or see if an
 application has an included examples. For instance, <B

>&#13; This gives us our default keyboard layout. Valid layout labels are listed in
 <TT

>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols</TT
>. Also, the
 <B
CLASS="command"
>setxkbmap</B
> utility can be used to change this
 interactively.

</P
><P
>&#13; <SPAN
CLASS="application"

 keyboard and mouse pointer mappings to suit our own preferences. The utility
 to do this is <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
> (see man page). You don't like where
 the capslock key is? So move it ;-)

</P
><P
>&#13; Like <B
CLASS="command"
>xrdb</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
> can be run from the
 command line. Or, preferred settings can be stored in a file. Typically this
 is <TT
CLASS="filename"
>~/.Xmodmap</TT
>, or similar. If your
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> start up files don't parse this, then edit as
 appropriate so that they do (probably from <TT
CLASS="filename"
>~/.xinitrc</TT
> or
 <TT
CLASS="filename"
>~/.xsession</TT
>).

</P
><P
>&#13; You can view your current key and mouse mappings with: <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap -pk
 -pp |less</B
>. This will print out all active <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"keycode"</SPAN
>
 values, with corresponding <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"keysym"</SPAN
> values, and any keysym names
 that <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
> knows about (e.g. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"BackSpace"</SPAN
>).
 And should also give you an idea of how <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
>
 understands key and mouse events. There are two keysyms per keycode. The
 second is the shifted value. XFree86's <B
CLASS="command"
>xev</B
> utility can be
 used to dump a lot of information on key-presses and mouse events
 interactively. Pay attention to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"keycode"</SPAN
> value. That is
 what you will need to know in order to re-map.

</P
><P
>&#13; <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
> is often used to make minor keyboard adjustments,
 like proper Backspace/Delete mapping. Or can be used make major adjustments
 such as for international mappings. You can only re-map keys and mouse events
 -- you cannot assign macros to key events (your Window Manager or Desktop
 might have some of this functionality).

 having one. On wheeled mice, the <SPAN

 button, if pressed. Many standard wheel mice seem to work with the

</P

>&#13; Specifically, the third button (middle) is the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"paste"</SPAN

 virtually all Linux applications. Copy and paste works a little different in
 Linux. The left button is the copy button. Just hold it down, and drag over
 text. It is automatically copied to the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"clipboard"</SPAN
>. Then, the middle button will paste from there. A
 very simple process. A double-click should copy individual words, and a
 triple-click individual lines of text. If for some reason, this does not
 work, it is either a poorly implemented application, or a bug of some kind.
 Some older versions of <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Netscape</SPAN

 consistent about this, for instance. To paste from the keyboard, this should 
 be shift+insert.

CLASS="QUOTE"

>&#13; The <SPAN

 field is specified, the X server will take the first match it finds in 
 the FontPath. This is why it is best to order the FontPath with preferred
 fonts coming first since some programs will deliberately specify fonts 
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

</P
><P
>&#13; The program <B
CLASS="command"
>xfontsel</B
> (<SPAN

 Font Selector) may be useful. Try launching it now. You will see 
 nothing helpful in the main window at first, but try holding the left button
 down on the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>fndry</TT
> button. If all your fonts are
 in order, you will see a menu of selections such as <TT
CLASS="literal"
>adobe</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>b&#38;h</TT
> and
 <TT
CLASS="literal"
>bitstream</TT
> and so forth. Select one such as
 <TT
CLASS="literal"
>b&#38;h</TT
> and you will notice that the font in
 the lower window changes to something intelligible. This is the way 
 fonts are selected with this program; starting from the left, which is the
 most general selection, and moving toward the right, to the more specific
 options. Selecting an option toward the rightmost end will not make much
 sense before the foundry, for instance, is selected, because the options are
 generally ordered by their dependence on each other. 
 
</P
><P
>&#13; When you select from the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>fmly</TT
> selection,
 you will see most of the options grayed out, and only three remaining. That
 means that these three are the only families of font made by this foundry.
 Some families appear under more than one foundry, for instance, both
 <EM
>Adobe</EM
> and <EM
>Bitstream</EM
> make a
 variation of the Courier font. Now you can select the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>wght</TT
>, and so forth. After you get far enough you will
 have narrowed it down to the font that you want. You don't necessarily have
 to fill in all the options to choose a single font, there's not
 <EM
>that</EM
> many fonts on your system! The options that you do
 not select will be represented by a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>*</TT
>
 indicating that any option will do in that spot, and gives X some leeway.
</P
><P
>&#13; When you are satisfied with your font selection, hit the select button,
 and your selection will be placed in the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>
 clipboard, ready to be pasted into your document or whatever you are working
 on. For example, open an <EM
>xterm</EM
> window and
 type in something like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xterm -font </TT
> followed by
 an opening quotation mark. Then point to that spot on your screen, and click
 your middle mouse button (or click both the left and right, if you are
 middle-button impaired). This will paste the selection from the clipboard,
 which should be the font you just selected. Then enter the closing quote, and
 hit <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Enter</TT
>. For instance, a nice big <EM
>xterm</EM
> with a Courier font specified would look like
 this: <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xterm -font
 "-adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"</TT
>. 
</P
><P
>&#13; If you've found a font you prefer, this can permanently be used by placing the 
 font definition in the appropriate configuration file (see above).

</P
><P
>&#13;  Note that you can also limit the number of fonts that you want 
  <B
CLASS="command"
>xfontsel</B

 <EM

 discussed above.

</P

>5.1.1. Type 1 and TrueType Fonts</H3
><P
>&#13; The fonts provided with XFree86 are of limited use for many of us,
 considering that about the only place you'll find fonts of that kind, are
 used in the X Window System itself for the most part. Unfortunately many
 media junkies, web designers and fontaholics work in operating systems that
 rely on other formats. And then, there often does not seem to be much
 emphasis by some distributions on making the best of the default fonts
 either. 
</P
><P
>&#13; Type 1 fonts, most commonly used in conjunction with PostScript document
 formats, are the traditional standard in Unix and Linux environments. You
 should have a reasonably good starter selection installed already. Or, more
 can be found for free on the Internet with considerable ease, and Try <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/</A
>
 for starters. Type 1 are scalable fonts, and have many of the same benefits
 of the better known TrueType fonts. If you don't have a good selection of
 TrueType fonts installed, then Type 1 is what you want for most GUI
 applications. But again, this is not standard on  other platforms, and can 
 present problems when viewing documents (e.g. web pages) that are designed 
 with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"other platforms"</SPAN
> in mind.

</P
><P
>&#13; TrueType fonts started with Apple, and later were licensed by Microsoft. So
 people migrating from non-Unix platforms are already familiar with these high
 quality fonts. Unfortunately, there are not many quality TrueType fonts under
 a suitable license, and thus there are not many included with Linux
 distributions. And the ones that are, often are not as high quality. Also
 unfortunately, TrueType has become somewhat of a standard on the Web and in
 other venues, and not having good TrueType fonts can be a detriment. 
 XFree86 also seems to render TrueType a little better than Type1.

</P
><P
>&#13; That is the bad news. The good news is that any TrueType font included with
 any version of Windows, or any Windows applications, should work on Linux.
 Though you will have to take some additional steps to integrate them. This 
 particularly helps web browsing where <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X's</SPAN
>
 bitmapped fonts just don't scale well.

>6.2. Desktop Environments</H2
><P
>&#13; Desktop Environments are not really new, but their popularity has increased
 with advent of the two big names: <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> and
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
>. To a certain extent, the Desktop
 Environment functionality overlaps the Window Manager's. They both can be
 responsible for the root window background, root window menu, icons,
 taskbars, etc. Generally speaking, if a Desktop Environment is running, it is
 controlling these aspects. That is the main idea behind them -- to integrate
 the various components into a cohesive, consistent whole. Desktop
 Environments also add some interoperability and ease-of-use features that a
 simple Window Manager cannot. 
</P
><P
>&#13; Oh, another point: Desktop Environments also try to do as much
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> session configuration as possible. Any of their
 compliant clients will more than likely be configured by the Desktop, or have
 it's own configuration that conforms to the Desktop's style. This is at
 least partly to avoid much of the seemingly helter-skelter text file
 configuration we looked at in the above sections, and make life a little
 easier for the user.

</P
><P
>&#13; There is a trade-off in this additional functionality, and that is that it
 takes memory and system resources to oversee all this. If you have plenty of
 memory and a fast computer, this is no problem. But in low memory situations,
 this can cause a slowdown (see the <A
HREF="#performance"
>performance
 section</A
> below). 64M of RAM is probably borderline with either 
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
>.

</P
><P
>&#13; So do you need a Desktop Environment? That is up to the user. They are
 certainly not required to run <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>, but do add
 features that many users want or expect in a GUI. Which one is better? Ah,
 but that is up to you to decide!

>&#13; Sooner or later, most of us need to access the <SPAN

 working in <SPAN

 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN

 is also a wealth of programs that run in <SPAN

 Linux. 

</P
><P
>&#13; This is possible via <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"terminal emulators"</SPAN

 <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
>. The closest counterpart from Microsoft is the
 so-called DOS-box, which is child's play by comparison. Linux terminals support
 color, full mouse copy/paste (and some wheeled mice), pseudo-transparency and
 pixmap backgrounds, scrollbars, menus and generally a slew of other 
 features. While <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
> is the best known such terminal 
 emulator, there are many similar programs. To name a few:
 <B
CLASS="command"
>Eterm</B

 <B

 (<SPAN

CLASS="command"
>gnome-terminal</B
>.

</P
><P
>&#13;  In typical usage, when a terminal emulator window is opened, a shell is
  started for the user to interact with. The default for essentially all
  Linuxes, is the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>bash</SPAN
> shell. So when all is said
  and done, the user is interacting with <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>, the
  terminal, and the shell all at once. Each may have it's own influence. For
  example, how keystrokes are handled since they move from hardware to X
  server to terminal to the shell and finally echoed back to the user.

</P
><P
> 
 Quick and easy terminal configuration is done via the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"$TERM"</SPAN
> 
 variable, which is typically set in one of the user's shell configuration
 files. Or the terminal itself will have a compiled in default. The default
 value for this is most often <SPAN

 Some additional terminal configuration can be done with the

 really beyond the scope of this document.

</P
><P
>&#13; The terminal application itself (e.g. <B

 have various configuration options. Permanent settings are best stored in 
 a <TT

> or similar file for those applications 
 that support this. Generally speaking, applications with a GUI configuration 
 (such as <B
CLASS="command"
>gnome-terminal</B
>), will be configured by their own
 menu driven configuration instead.

</P
><P
>&#13; Also, you are interacting with the shell too, which can have it's own impact,
 particularly on how keystrokes are handled at the shell prompt. For
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>bash</SPAN

 <TT
CLASS="filename"

>9. Performance Considerations</H1
><P
>&#13; As has been discussed, what we call <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>, is actually
 a convergence of various components: X server, Window Manager, Desktop, etc.
 With MS Windows, the GUI desktop is tightly integrated with the operating
 system itself. This is not the case in Linux which follows the Unix tradition
 of combining various independent components to achieve some end result. So we
 have choices with each component and it's attendant configuration and
 implementation. In short, much flexibility. This is where you come in. You
 can try various possibilities and decide what you gives you the most bang for
 the buck.

</P
><P
>&#13; On low end hardware, this gives us much latitude to decrease the demand on
 available system resources. This is good because, if given the opportunity,
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> can be quite greedy with system resources. If
 you've recently installed a new Linux distribution, you've probably been
 given a default Desktop with many bells and whistles. And something
 that will probably need a fair amount of memory and CPU to achieve a
 reasonable level of performance. If you have the horse power, this should not
 be a problem.

</P
><P
>&#13; It is often said that Linux functions very well with relatively little
 memory. This is true to a point. It does not mean though that every possible
 configuration will run with low memory. So if you want to use memory hungry
 applications, then you will have to have the memory. Or you will have to make
 sacrifices to achieve a satisfactory level of performance. It is quite
 possible to run <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> with reasonable performance on
 16 Meg of RAM, and even less if you really want to push it. But you would
 have to live with some real limitations.

</P
><P
>&#13; Let's look at some of the components and ways to decrease the demand on
 system resources, in case you are at the low end on hardware, or performance
 is not up to expectations.

 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; Graphics cards are of course necessary, and the X server's video performance
 is tied to the card's chipset, and the corresponding XFree86 driver. Just
 because a given card is supported by XFree86 does not necessarily mean it is
 as well optimized as other cards! It may also perform better at a lower color
 depth (see below). It may well be worth the trip to xfree86.org to see if
 there are any notes related to your card with respect to performance or other
 issues.

 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;  And you might try other versions of XFree86. At this time v4.2 was just
  recently released. Some cards may still perform better with 3.3.6 due to the
  way v4.x is being incrementally developed. If you are using x4.x and
  performance is not good, then make sure you are using the latest available
  version.

><P
>&#13; The more memory, the better. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN

 caching to help performance. But caching requires memory, and if there isn't
 much to start with, then we would need to reduce memory requirements. Some
 tips for those with low memory or performance problems:
</P
><P
>&#13; <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13; Use the <B
CLASS="command"
>free</B
> command to make sure all memory and swap is
 recognized. 

 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; Make sure you don't have other system services that are hogging memory or
 CPU. Use <B
CLASS="command"
>top</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>ps</B
> to see what is
 running, and disable anything you can to free up memory and CPU. Again, a
 default installation may have many things running that you don't really
 need.
 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; Make sure you have plenty of swap space. With low, or even modest, memory,
 swap is all the more important. A general rule of thumb is twice as much swap
 as physical memory. With low memory, this is not enough. Try four times real
 memory. Or more. If you can't create more swap partitions, see the
 <B
CLASS="command"
>mkswap</B
> man page about creating swap files instead.
 Constant disk churning is a symptom of insufficient swap space, and the
 system will be slowed as a result, sometimes drastically. Or, possibly this
 may be the symptom of a poorly behaved kernel VM system (try another kernel
 in this case).

 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; Drive performance is important for swap performance. Make sure your drive has
 DMA enabled if the drive supports it, and is otherwise tuned and performing
 up to snuff. See the <B
CLASS="command"
>hdparm</B
> man page. Slow drive + slow
 card + low memory = slow system.
 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; Don't use <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
>
 if memory is tight. These both require substantial memory, and are not
 required to just run <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>. Think of these as
 usability enhancements. 32M probably may not be enough. 64M may be decent,
 depending on what other applications are being used, and other variables. 128M
 <EM
>should</EM
> be adequate in most situations. 256M or more to
 be comfortable. File Managers like <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Nautilus</SPAN
> and
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>gmc</SPAN

>&#13;   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X server"</SPAN

   with your video card and other system hardware, and manages the 
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN

   requests from clients as well. There are different X servers for different
   chipsets.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   X Servers are referenced in the form of:
  </P
><P
>&#13;   <EM
>host.domain:display_number.screen_number</EM

  </P
><P
>&#13;   An example would look like: <EM

  </P

>&#13;   If host (and domain) is omitted, localhost is assumed. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Host"</SPAN

   can be a remote host. If <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"screen"</SPAN
> is omitted, then
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"0"</SPAN
> (the first screen) is assumed. In it's shortest form, the
   X server is often represented as just <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>":0"</SPAN

   first local <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN

CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN

   multiple <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

  </P

   relation to X servers, in addition to their more common usage.

  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    When <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN

    one or more <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"displays"</SPAN

CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> can
    have more than one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    common configuration for the average user). Each <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN

    a separate instance of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X"</SPAN
>. The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN
>
    includes not only the obvious video components, but also the keyboard,
    mouse and other input type components. The user can only access one
    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>display</SPAN

    monitor. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    wants when he logs in. Each <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN

    unique configuration (e.g. resolution). But again, the most typical 
    configuration is just one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   In reference to X servers, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   And there can be more than one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   have more than one <SPAN

   <SPAN

   instance. In fact you can even have more than one computer running off a

   be aware of this degree of flexibility as it is an important ingredient of
   the <SPAN

  </P

><LI
><P
>&#13;    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    contexts. Often, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    called the <SPAN

    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN

CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN

    as well-known <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>CDE</SPAN

    applications that control much of how the user interacts with the
    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN

    feel, as well as consistent configuration and come bundled with their own
    set of utilities for common tasks.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Desktop"</SPAN

   This is more of the MS Window's meaning. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>
   environments though are capable of having multiple virtual
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desktops"</SPAN
> that can be switched between as needed. This helps with
   organizing different tasks. Each <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desktop"</SPAN
> may its own windows
   and clients that are specific to it. Right now I have seven
   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>WindowMaker</SPAN
> desktops
   (<SPAN
CLASS="application"
>WindowMaker</SPAN
> calls them
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"WorkSpaces"</SPAN
>), and one of those I have dedicated to writing
   this document. This <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desktop"</SPAN

   the moment (man pages, browser windows, clock, gvim, xterms, etc).
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Clients"</SPAN
> are any program that connect to the X server, and
   require an X server for some task (e.g. to display itself). Often, these
   are displayed in their own <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"window"</SPAN
>, but not always. For
   instance, if I use <TT
CLASS="literal"
>CTRL-N</TT
> to open a new
   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Mozilla</SPAN
> window, this is one
   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> client but with two windows. If I run a command
   line <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> utility like <B
CLASS="command"
>xev</B
> to
   view key and mouse events, this runs in the <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm's</B
>
   window, so has none of its own, but is still a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"client"</SPAN
>.
   Clients can be locally running applications, or applications that are
   running on another system over the network, but are displayed locally.

   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Window Manager"</SPAN
> is a special type of client application 
   and a user definable component of the GUI. It is what the user interacts
   with to a large extent. The Window Manager provides such functionality as
   window borders and decorations, menus, icons, virtual desktops, button
   bars, tool bars, and allows the user to customize these. It is technically
   possible to run <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> without a window manager
   (though not very functional), but not the other way around. Window managers
   should not be confused with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Desktop Environments"</SPAN
> like
   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
>. Desktop Environments include their own
   preferred Window Manager, but this is a configurable. There is some
   overlapping of responsibilities between Window Managers and Desktop
   Environments.

   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root window"</SPAN
> is the background of your screen. It is
   referred to as a window in name alone, it does not behave like any other
   window, but rather you run your applications on the root window, or put an
   image on it, or perhaps just a solid color. All other windows are children 
   of this parent window. The root window conceivably can be larger than the viewable 
   screen area.

   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"pointer"</SPAN

   given shape which represents the location of your mouse, or other pointing
   device. The pointer often changes to give you contextual feedback as to
   what will happen when you use the mouse at that point on the screen.

   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"window"</SPAN

   and which is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"managed"</SPAN
> by the Window Manager. This includes
   pretty much anything except the so-called root window. Even windows which
   do not appear to have frames, titles, or normal borders of any kind are
   being managed by your window manger. The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"active window"</SPAN
> is
   the window you are currently using. This window will will respond to the
   keyboard when you type, and is traditionally denoted by the fact that your
   mouse cursor is pointing at it, though this is not always the case. The
   active window is said to have <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"focus"</SPAN
>. Most Window Managers
   will somehow highlight the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"active"</SPAN
>, or focused, window to
   differentiate it from other windows.

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   Windows that run text only applications are called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"terminal
   emulators"</SPAN

CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
> and various 
   similar applications. This is the well-known <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   an X environment. These basically emulate a console text-only display, and
   have some advantages due to their being used in
   <SPAN
CLASS="application"

   applications than a simple <SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Widgets"</SPAN

   components as buttons, sliders, menus, scrollbars, listboxes, checkboxes, etc.
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Motif</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>QT</SPAN

   by <SPAN

   or another. Sometimes the same application can be built with different
   toolkits, depending on compile time options.
