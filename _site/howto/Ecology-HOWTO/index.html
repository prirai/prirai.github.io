>&#13;   The Linux-Ecology-HOWTO discusses ways to make computers less harmful to
   our environment and to solve some ecological issues.  It explains how to
   use Linux to save power and consumables like paper and ink. Since it does
   not require big hardware, Linux may be used with old computers to make
   their life cycle longer. Games may be used in environmental education and
   software is available to simulate ecological processes.

" .. for APM to work on any notebook or energy-conscious desktop, the system BIOS ROM in the machine must support the APM standard. Furthermore, for APM to work with the Linux operating system, the system BIOS ROM must support either the 1.0 or 1.1 version of the APM standard, and it must also support 32-bit protected mode connections. A system that supports APM 1.1 is preferred, as it provides more features that the device driver and supporting utilities can take advantage of."

- A feature implemented in the Linux kernel since the 2.6.6 version.

is available since kernel 2.6.21 and later.
When enabled, this kernel feature allows to disable the
CPU timer interrupts when all processors are idle.
This way, idle systems are not woken up every 4 ms
(default setting in Linux 2.6) just to realize there is nothing to do!
This can save a little bit of power in notebooks
(and CPU cycles in virtual hosting servers). 
Regular timer interrupts are re-enabled when something
really happens, when a real hardware interrupt is received.
In kernel configuration, this feature can be selected
from the <B
CLASS="command"
>Kernel Features</B
>
section (<B
CLASS="command"
>NO_IDLE_HZ</B
> setting).
You can verify whether it is enabled with

   noise while the temperature is in a safe range chosen by the user. So fan

</P
><P
>&#13;You can do double-sided printing, in two passes, as follows. If you use 3-hole punched paper, put it in  the  printer such that the holes will appear at the top of the page -- on the right as you pull out the  printer  tray,  in  our  Laser  writer II NTX. Print the odd-numbered sheets with

</P
><P
>&#13;Note the number of pages it  reports.   (Only  half this  many  will really be printed).  When printing finishes, if mpage reported an odd number of pages, remove  the  last  one  from the stack, since there will be no even-numbered sheet to match  it.   Then arrange  the  stack  of  paper  for printing on the other side.  (If it's punched, the holes  will  now be  on  the  left.)  On our II NTX, the paper comes out blank-side up; replace it  in  the  tray  still blank-side  up  but rotated 180 degrees.  For other printers, you figure it out.  Now print  the  even- numbered sheets in reverse order with

>&#13;Another means of saving paper is through the use of comments and redline/strikeout markings when exchanging a document with a co-worker/colaborator. For example, a draft could be written using WordPerfect, then E-MAILed to a co-worker. They could update the draft and send it back to you. You can use WordPerfect's redline/strikeout features to see the changes. The document need not be printed until it is "final" or in "final draft" status.

>&#13;Question: Can you use the back side of paper in a laser printer? I have not had much luck. You can use the paper that has been in a laser printer in an inkjet printer by using the other side.
</P
><P
>&#13;You should purchase smaller computers and monitors when possible. This will save packaging material translating into less solid waste. For example the box for a 15" CRT monitor is 2-3 times the size of the box for a 15" LCD monitor. Linux works well with 15" LCD monitors on smaller computers like the Netwinder or <A

</P

>&#13;Tough smaller monitors may have another ecological caveat: because it's inconvenient to browse to longer documents, people may tend to print the documents instead of reading them from the screen.
</P
><P
>&#13;Some have expressed the concern that LCD displays may use more toxic materials and manufacturing processes than CRT displays, hence their usage actually may be worse on the environment. The original information above concerned the solid waste issue, which is fairly tangible and hence more controllable.

extern attacks. However, the constraint is that software upgrades can no
longer be done when the filesystem is mounted. The whole filesystem contents must
be rebuilt and replaced at once.

is the solution everyone should use now. Unlike CramFS, it has
no limitations on filesystem and file size, and it achieves
much better compression and read speed (up to 5 times!). 
On slow storage (like USB flash drives), replacing ext2
with SquashFS resulting in a 50% reduction on system boot time

It takes approximately 400 KB instead of 1700 (glibc). It used by many embedded Linux projects

making your system much more responsive) and support for recent peripherals.
It is true that the Linux kernel accumulated bloat over the years: more features, support for more special cases...
Now that Linux is taking an increasingly dominant place in embedded systems, work is being done to control the kernel size.
The <A
HREF="http://www.selenic.com/linux-tiny/"
TARGET="_top"
>LinuxTiny</A
> project releases a set of patches to
the Linux kernel sources. In the <B
CLASS="command"
>Configure Standard Kernel Features for Small Systems</B
>
kernel configuration section, you can unselect features you do not need in a simple computer.
The minimum compressed size you can achieve for a Linux 2.6 kernel for a simple PC is approximately 350 KB. 
Note that more and more LinuxTiny changes are now available in the standard Linux kernel (no patching necessary).
</P
><P
>&#13;With the latest kernel releases, you may also try 
the <A
HREF="http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;real-time preemption patches</A
> from Ingo Molnar.
When full preemption is enabled, it adds unprecedented
responsiveness to the Linux kernel. The latency is much reduced,
suitable for real real-time systems (less than 100 us!).
It is definitely worth trying on old systems
to give them a new youth and improve the user experience!

Or you can buy an older computer (SGI, Sun, NeXT) that comes with unix and is capable of running a wide range of open source software. In some cases (SGI Indigo2) you can still run current OS versions, in others you may do better with an open source OS such as Linux, but in either case you have access to lots of good software and tools to write your own.

The lower power consumption of older computers means you get more reserve time from an UPS or can use a small alternative power source if you don't have access to "mains" power.

   energy consumption of different computer types along the life cycle. The
   production of computers actually needs 535 kWh which is 10 % less than 4
   years ago. Most of the energy will be consumed while the computer is used
   for example at work for 8 hours/day. The energy consumption of new
   computers with 2,5-3 GHz processors is even in the
   stand-bye-mode still 100 Watt, whereas a 1,4 GHz PC needs 80
   Watt and a 4 year old PC only needed 60 Watt. Therefore from the
   ecological point of view it is better to buy an old computer
   that didn't need the energy for a new production and which
   consumes less electricity while it is being used.

   laptops are the most ecological types of the compared computers. They

   energy than new examples. There is also an article in the

   "Card Services can be compiled with support for APM
   (Advanced Power Management) if you've configured your kernel

   be configured for APM if a compatible version is detected on
   your system. Whether or not APM is configured, you can use
   <B
CLASS="command"
>cardctl suspend</B

   laptop, and <B
CLASS="command"
>cardctl resume</B
> after resuming,
   to cleanly shut down and restart your PCMCIA cards. This will
   not work with a modem that is in use, because the serial
   driver isn't able to save and restore the modem operating
   parameters. APM seems to be unstable on some systems. If you
   experience trouble with APM and PCMCIA on your system, try to
   narrow down the problem to one package or the other before
   reporting a bug. Some drivers, notably the PCMCIA SCSI
   drivers, cannot recover from a suspend/resume cycle.  When
   using a PCMCIA SCSI card, always use <B
CLASS="command"

In the specifications of my HP

off the IR port, if it is not in use,

If necessary, you may also try to

>Appendix D. Appendix D - Recommendations for Buying a New Computer</H1
><P
>&#13;Courtesy of Wade Hampton (modifications by wh): Purchase a low-power computer such as a laptop or network computer. These typically don't use as much power as desktop systems. For example, someone on the WWW had a Corel/Rebel Netwinder powered by solar cells. I find it funny that an "Energy Star" desktop still has a 300W power supply and uses far more power than a computer like the Netwinder which uses something like 10 Watts of power, (though this is consistent with the Energy Star goals for computer equipment, since they have targeted unused power consumption).
</P
><P
>&#13;Maybe there should be a new class of computers called "Energy Miser" (or similar) that use nearly an order of magnitude less power than Energy Star systems?
</P
><P
>&#13;To save power for the display, one could purchase a LCD monitor instead of a CRT. LCD monitors consume 30-40 Watts of power versus the 100's of Watts used by most monitors.  The price of an LCD is still 2-3 times that of a similar monitor, but as LCDs become more widely used, the price will come down.
</P
><P
>&#13;Make sure that any new computer purchase includes APM-compliant hardware and low-radiation. Use TCO, DPMS or Energy Star compliant monitors.

They go into considerable details on how to reduce energy consumption from many kinds of equipment, including much more than computers.  They also have a good collection of links to related sites. The Energy Star program is defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has a web site on it. So far all of the Energy Star regulations have been defined to reduce energy usage without requireing change or restrictions on regular usage.  There is an amazingly large amount of electricity consumed by idle equipment (computers, televisions, microwave ovens,...) and also large amounts consumed unnecessarily by equipment that must be continuously one (emergency exit signs, traffic lights, ...). Since this energy can be saved without asking users to make any compromises on performance, it is being targeted first.
</P
><P
>&#13;Somewhere on the LBL web site they have the actual power consumption figures for various PCs. The 300W power supply is quite misleading. Actual power usage varies depending upon what programs you run and whether the disks can be powered down. Genuine usage while in operation is usually in the 50-75W range. When the system is idle, it drops significantly.
</P
><P
>&#13;The NetWinder is a nice machine, but does force operational compromises. The peak CPU performance is much lower.  The operating system is not Windows.  And there are other limitations. A closer comparison is the typical laptop PC.  These can generally be operated from a modest solar panel because their average power drain is quite low.  With these you can see the cost vs power consumption tradeoff. They achieve the same performance as the desktop units, but the low power consumption has doubled or tripled the cost.
</P
><P
>&#13;(I personally use a Psion.  A decent slow computer that requires only 200mw of power. It may even run Linux once they deal with some of the ROM issues.)
</P
><P
>&#13;The big debate in setting the energy star regulations was deciding which would have greater overall benefit: small negligible cost improvements to almost all equipment sold, or greater improvements at much higher cost? Could that cost be invested elsewhere to greater benefit?  How will the purchasers react to the higher cost? So far the consensus has been that improving a large number of machines at negligible cost is wiser than improving a smaller number of machines at high cost."

>&#13;When computer waste processing channels are not available yet in
your country, or are just not mature enough yet, another idea is too keep
your computer waste a few more years in your attic or in your cellar (provided
you have storage space). Better processing channels and recycling technologies
will become available over the years. 
</P

>&#13;In some countries like France (and probably in the whole European Union),
local law makes it mandatory for consumer device shops to accept
old devices for free when you buy a new one, to ensure suitable processing
