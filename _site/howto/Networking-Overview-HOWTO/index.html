<P>The purpose of this document is to give an overview of the networking
capabilities of the Linux operating system. Although one of the strengths of
Linux is that plenty of information exists for nearly every component of it,
most of this information is focused on implementation. New Linux users,
particularly those coming from a Windows environment, are often unaware of the networking possibilities of Linux. This document aims to show a general picture of such possibilities with a brief description of each one and pointers for further information. The information has been gathered from many sources: HOWTOs, faqs, projects' web pages and my own hands-on experience. Full credit is given to the authors of these other sources. Without them and their programs this document would have not been possible or necessary.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc2.1">What is Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P>The primary author of Linux is Linus Torvalds. Since his original versions, it has been improved by countless numbers of people. It is a clone, written entirely from scratch, of the Unix operating system. One of the more interesting facts about Linux is that its development occurs simultaneously around the world.</P>
<P>Linux has been copyrighted under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). This is a license written by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) that is designed to prevent people from restricting the distribution of software. In brief, it says that although money can be charged for a copy, the person who received the copy can not be prevented from giving it away for free. It also means that the source code must be available. This is useful for programmers. Anybody can modify Linux and even distribute his/her modifications, provided that they keep the code under the same copyright.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc2.2">What makes Linux different?</A>
</H2>

<P>Why work on Linux? Linux is generally cheaper (or at least no more expensive) than other operating systems and is frequently less problematic than many commercial systems. But what makes Linux different is not its price (after all, why would anyone want an OS - even a free one - if it is not good enough?) but its outstanding capabilities:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Linux is a true 32-bit multitasking operating system, robust and capable enough to be used in organizations ranging from universities to large corporations. </LI>
<LI>It runs on hardware ranging from low-end 386 boxes to massive ultra-parallel machines in research centres. </LI>
<LI>Out-of-the-box versions are available for Intel, Sparc, and Alpha architectures, and experimental support exists for Power PC and embedded systems, among others such as SGI, Ultra Sparc, AP1000+, Strong ARM, and MIPS R3000/R4000.</LI>
<LI>Finally, when it comes to networking, Linux is choice. Not only because networking is tightly integrated with the OS itself and a plethora of applications is freely available, but for the robustness under heavy loads that can only be achieved after years of debugging and testing in an Open Source project. </LI>

<H2><A NAME="s3">3.</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3">Networking protocols</A></H2>


<P>Linux supports many different networking protocols:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">TCP/IP</A>
</H2>


<P>The Internet Protocol was originally developed two decades ago for the United States Department of Defense (DoD), mainly for the purpose of interconnecting different-brand computers. The TCP/IP suite of protocols allowed, through its layered structure, to insulate applications from networking hardware.</P>
<P>Although it is based on a layered model, it is focused more on delivering interconnectivity than on rigidly adhering to functional layers. This is one of the reasons why TCP/IP has become the de facto standard internetworking protocol as opposed to OSI.</P>
<P>TCP/IP networking has been present in Linux since its beginnings. It has been implemented from scratch. It is one of the most robust, fast and reliable implementations and is one of the key factors of the success of Linux.</P>
<P>Related HOWTO: 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO.html">http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO.html</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.2">TCP/IP version 6</A>
</H2>


<P>IPv6, sometimes also referred to as IPng (IP Next Generation) is an upgrade to the IPv4 protocol in order to address many issues. These issues include: shortage of available IP addresses, lack of mechanisms to handle time-sensitive traffic, lack of network layer security, etc. </P>
<P>The larger name space will be accompanied by an improved addressing scheme, which will have a great impact on routing performance.
A beta implementation exists for Linux, and a production version is expected for the 2.2.0 Linux kernel release.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.3">IPX/SPX</A>
</H2>

<P>IPX/SPX (Internet Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange) is a proprietary protocol stack developed by Novell and based on the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocol. IPX/SPX became prominent during the early 1980s as an integral part of Novell, Inc.'s NetWare. NetWare became the de facto standard network operating system (NOS) of first generation LANs. Novell complemented its NOS with a business-oriented application suite and client-side connection utilities.</P>
<P>Linux has a very clean IPX/SPX implementation, allowing it to be configured as an:
<UL>
<LI> IPX router</LI>
<LI> IPX bridge</LI>
<LI> NCP client and/or NCP Server (for sharing files)</LI>
<LI> Novell Print Client, Novell Print Server</LI>
</UL>

And to:
<UL>
<LI> Enable PPP/IPX, allowing a Linux box to act as a PPP server/client </LI>
<LI> Perform IPX tunnelling through IP, allowing the connection of two IPX networks through an IP only link</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Additionally, 
<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com">Caldera</A> offers commercial support for Novell NetWare under Linux. Caldera provides a fully featured Novell NetWare client built on technology licensed from Novell Corporation. The client provides full client access to Novell 3.x and 4.x fileservers and includes features such as NetWare Directory Service (NDS) and RSA encryption.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.4">AppleTalk Protocol Suite</A>
</H2>

<P>Appletalk is the name of Apple's internetworking stack. It allows a peer-to-peer network model which provides basic functionality such as file and printer sharing. Each machine can simultaneously act as a client and a server, and the software and hardware necessary are included with every Apple computer.</P>
<P>Linux provides full Appletalk networking. Netatalk is a kernel-level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-derived systems. It includes support for routing AppleTalk, serving Unix and AFS filesystems over AFP (AppleShare), serving Unix printers and accessing AppleTalk printers over PAP.</P>

<P>The Linux kernel has built-in support for PPP (Point-to-Point-Protocol), SLIP (Serial Line IP) and PLIP (Parallel Line IP). PPP is the most popular way individual users access their ISPs (Internet Service Providers). PLIP allows the cheap connection of two machines. It uses a parallel port and a special cable, achieving speeds of 10kBps to 20kBps. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc5.2">Windows Environment</A>
</H2>

<P>Samba is a suite of applications that allow most Unices (and in particular Linux) to integrate into a Microsoft network both as a client and a server. Acting as a server it allows Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups, DOS and Windows NT clients to access Linux files and printing services. It can completely replace Windows NT for file and printing services, including the automatic downloading of printer drivers to clients. Acting as a client allows the Linux workstation to mount locally exported windows file shares.</P>
<P>According to the SAMBA Meta-FAQ:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
"Many users report that compared to other SMB implementations Samba is more stable, 
faster, and compatible with more clients. Administrators of some large installations say 
that Samba is the only SMB server available which will scale to many tens of thousands 
of users without crashing"

</H2>

<P>The preferred way to share files in a Unix networking environment is through NFS. NFS stands for Network File Sharing and it is a protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems. It is a way to share files between machines as if they were local. A client "mounts" a filesystem "exported" by an NFS server. The mounted filesystem will appear to the client machine as if it was part of the local filesystem. </P>
<P>It is possible to mount the root filesystem at startup time, thus allowing diskless clients to boot up and access all files from a server. In other words, it is possible to have a fully functional computer without a hard disk.</P>
<P>Coda is a network filesystem (like NFS) that supports disconnected
operation, persistant caching, among other goodies. 
It's included in 2.2.x kernels. Really handy for slow or unreliable networks
and laptops.  </P>

<P>Linux is a great platform to act as an Intranet / Internet server. The term Intranet refers to the application of Internet technologies inside an organisation mainly for the purpose of distributing and making available information inside the company. Internet and Intranet services offered by Linux include mail, news, WWW servers and many more that will be outlined in the next sections.</P>

<H3>Remote access to mail </H3>

<P>In an organisation or ISP, users will likely access their mail remotely from their desktops. Several alternatives exist in Linux, including POP (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) servers.

<P>Fetchmail retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it via SMTP, so it can then be be read by normal mail user agents such as mutt, elm or BSD Mail. It allows all the system MTA's filtering, forwarding, and aliasing facilities to work just as they would on normal mail.</P>
<P>Fetchmail can be used as a POP/IMAP-to-SMTP gateway for an entire DNS domain, collecting mail from a single drop box on an ISP and SMTP-forwarding it based on header addresses.</P>

fetchmail to collect all outgoing mail, send it via a single mailbox 
at their ISP and retrieve all incoming mail from the same mailbox.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc7.3">The X Window System</A>
</H2>

<P>The X Window System was developed at MIT in the late 1980s, rapidly becoming the industry standard windowing system for Unix graphics workstations. The software is freely available, very versatile, and is suitable for a wide range of hardware platforms. Any X environment consists of two distinct parts, the X server and one or more X clients. It is important to realise the distinction between the server and the client. The server controls the display directly and is responsible for all input/output via the keyboard, mouse or display. The clients, on the other hand, do not access the screen directly - they communicate with the server, which handles all input and output. It is the clients which do the "real" computing work - running applications or whatever. The clients communicate with the server, causing the server to open one or more windows to handle input and output for that client.</P>
<P>In short, the X Window System allows a user to log in into a remote machine, execute a process (for example, open a web browser) and have the output displayed on his own machine. Because the process is actually being executed on the remote system, very little CPU power is needed in the local one. Indeed, computers exist whose primary purpose is to act as pure X servers.  Such systems are called X terminals.</P>
<P>A free port of the X Window System exists for Linux and can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">Xfree</A>. It is included in most Linux distributions.</P>

The opposite is also true; it is possible to execute an application in a Linux machine and have the output displayed in any other Linux or Windows machine. One of the available clients is a Java applet, allowing the remote display to be run inside a web browser. Another client is a port for Linux using the SVGAlib graphics library, allowing 386s with as little as 4 MB of RAM to become fully functional X-Terminals.</P>

<P>Port Forwarding can provide an almost ideal solution to this access problem.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.9">8.9</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc8.9">Load Balancing</A>
</H2>

<P>Demand for load balancing usually arises in database/web access when many clients make simultaneous requests to a server. It would be desirable to have multiple identical servers and redirect requests to the less loaded server. This can be achieved through Network Address Translation techniques (NAT) of which IP masquerading is a subset. Network administrators can replace a single server providing Web services - or any other application - with a logical pool of servers sharing a common IP address. Incoming connections are directed to a particular server using one load-balancing algorithm. The virtual server rewrites incoming and outgoing packets to give clients the appearance that only one server exists.</P>

</H2>

<P>The term proxy means "to do something on behalf of someone else." In networking terms, a proxy server computer can act on the behalf of several clients. An HTTP proxy is a machine that receives requests for web pages from another machine (Machine A). The proxy gets the page requested and returns the result to Machine A. The proxy may have a cache with the requested pages, so if another machine asks for the same page the copy in the cache will be returned instead. This allows efficient use of bandwidth resources and less response time. As a side effect, as client machines are not directly connected to the outside world this is a way of securing the internal network. A well-configured proxy can be as effective as a good firewall.</P>

<P>The Linux kernel allows the tunnelling (encapsulation) of protocols. It can do IPX tunnelling through IP, allowing the connection of two IPX networks through an IP only link. It can also do IP-IP tunnelling, which it is essential for mobile IP support, multicast support and amateur radio. (see 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO-6.html#ss6.8">http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO-6.html#ss6.8</A>)</P>
<P>Mobile IP specifies enhancements that allow transparent routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node. </P>
<P>Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a networking technology that allows the use of the Internet as a secure virtual private network (VPN). PPTP is integrated with the Remote Access Services (RAS) server which is built into Windows NT Server. With PPTP, users can dial into a local ISP, or connect directly to the Internet, and access their network as if they were at their desks. PPTP is a closed protocol and its security has recently being compromised. It is highly recomendable to use other Linux based alternatives, since they rely on open standards which have been carefully examined and tested.</P>

</H2>

<P>The Simple Network Management Protocol is a protocol for Internet network management services. It allows for remote monitoring and configuration of routers, bridges, network cards, switches, etc... There is a large amount of libraries, clients, daemons and SNMP based monitoring programs available for Linux. A good page dealing with SNMP and Linux software may be found at :

<P>In certain situations it is necessary for the networking infrastructure to have proper mechanisms to guarantee network availability nearly 100% of the time. Some related techniques are described in the following sections. Most of the following material can be found at the excellent Linas website: 
<A HREF="http://linas.org/linux/index.html">http://linas.org/linux/index.html</A> and in the 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/ALPHA/linux-ha/High-Availability-HOWTO.html">Linux High-Availability HOWTO</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc10.1">High Availability </A>
</H2>

<P>Redundancy is used to prevent the overall IT system from having single points of failure. A server with only one network card or a single SCSI disk has two single points of failure. The objective is to mask unplanned outages from users in a manner that lets users continue to work quickly. High availability software is a set of scripts and tools that automatically monitor and detect failures, taking the appropriate steps to restore normal operation and to notifying system administrators.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc10.2">RAID</A>
</H2>

<P>RAID, short for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, is a method whereby information is spread across several disks, using techniques such as disk striping (RAID Level 0) and disk mirroring (RAID level 1) to achieve redundancy, lower latency and/or higher bandwidth for reading and/or writing, and recoverability from hard-disk crashes. Over six different types of RAID configurations have been defined. There are three types of RAID solution options available to Linux users: software RAID, outboard DASD boxes, and RAID disk controllers.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Software RAID: Pure software RAID implements the various RAID levels in the kernel disk (block device) code. </LI>
<LI>Outboard DASD Solutions: DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) are separate boxes that come with their own power supply, provide a cabinet/chassis for holding the hard drives, and appear to Linux as just another SCSI device. In many ways, these offer the most robust RAID solution.</LI>
<LI>RAID Disk Controllers: Disk Controllers are adapter cards that plug into the ISA/EISA/PCI bus. Just like regular disk controller cards, a cable attaches them to the disk drives. Unlike regular disk controllers, the RAID controllers will implement RAID on the card itself, performing all necessary operations to provide various RAID levels.</LI>

</H2>

<P>IP Address Takeover (IPAT). When a network adapter card fails, its IP address should be taken by a working network card in the same node or in another node. MAC Address Takeover: when an IP takeover occurs, it should be made sure that all the nodes in the network update their ARP caches (the mapping between IP and MAC addresses). </P>

<P>If you have networking problems with Linux, please do not e-mail the questions
to me. I just simply do not have the time to answer them. You have better
chances to obtain help if you post a question in the
comp.os.linux.networking newsgroup (which you can access through 
<A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">http://www.dejanews.com</A>). Before
posting there, make sure that you have read the relevant documentation.
Then search the news archive, because chances are that somebody, sometime
made the same question (and somebody answered).
When posting, remember to explain all the steps you have followed and the
error messages you got.
