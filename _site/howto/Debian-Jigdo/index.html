>Getting Debian ISOs has always been a painful, slow and supremely inefficient process.
  Jigdo is a tool for distributing and obtaining Debian ISOs in an easy, fast and very efficient
  manner.  This HOWTO describes why you should use jigdo, a little bit about how it works and how
  you use it to get and update Debian ISOs.</P
><P
>Jigdo is a very general tool, and isn't tied specifically to Debian ISOs.  The jigdo tools
  can be used to make any ISO available for download in the same easy, fast and efficient manner
  they're used for Debian ISOs.  This HOWTO will cover this as well, but we'll focus primarily on
  downloading Debian ISOs.</P

      This definitely has merit since some of the vendors donate money back to the Debian project.
      Your donations help make sure that Debian is around for a long time.</P
><P
>Another way of getting a set of Debian CDs is to burn your own set.  This first entails
      obtaining an ISO image and then burning that ISO image to a blank CD.  Before jigdo, there
      were two ways of creating Debian CDs:</P

><P
>There are mirrors which offer http and ftp downloads of Debian ISOs.  The problem is
      that there are very few mirror sites, and their bandwidth can't support everyone who wants
      Debian ISOs.  For example, fsn.hu has reportedly saturated the connection of its provider.
      The outgoing traffic reaches a few terabytes per month!</P
><P
>In addition, Debian testing and unstable get updated often.  Your ISOs may become
      outdated the same day you download them unless you find some sneaky way of updating them like
      mounting the ISO on a loopback device and using rsync (which is what the PIK did).  So if you
      want up-to-date ISO images, you must download a new set of ISO images every day.  Clearly,
      this is not the way you want to obtain Debian ISOs!</P
><P
>Even if you want to download the stable ISO images, they still get updated every few
      months.  Downloading the ISO images will give you up-to-date images for a few months, but
      every time a new revision of Debian stable is released, you'll need to go through the painful
      process of downloading the entire ISO set from scratch.  This is not a good use of your time
      and the mirror's resources.</P

>Jigdo (which stands for "Jigsaw Download") was written by <A
HREF="mailto:atterer@debian.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Richard Atterer</A
> and is released under the GNU GPL.
      It's a tool that allows efficient downloading and updating of an ISO image.  Any ISO image.
      Jigdo is not Debian specific, however Debian has chosen it to be the official method of
      downloading ISO images.</P
><P
>A common misconception is that jigdo creates ISO images; it doesn't.  Let's discuss the
      overall process of how jigdo allows you to obtain an ISO image.  Let Adam (a Debian release
      manager) be the person offering the ISO image.  Let Betty (a Debian user) be the person who
      wants to download the ISO image.</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Adam first creates an ISO image suitable for burning a CD.  He might use a utility
        like <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mkisofs</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>debian-cd</SPAN
> to create
        the ISO image.  He also creates two small files associated with his newly created image: a
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.jigdo</TT
> file and a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.template</TT
> file.  He makes these
        two files available for download to anyone who wants to obtain his ISO image.</P

><P
>Betty then downloads the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.template</TT

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>jigdo-lite</SPAN

        with these two files to download Adam's ISO image.</P

        <SPAN

>jigdo-light</SPAN

        thing here is that she only downloads the differences between her old ISO and Adam's new
        ISO.  She does not have to re-download the parts that are unchanged.</P

>A CD image is a filesystem called iso9660, but for this discussion, we can safely talk
      about a CD image as being a big file called an "ISO image" (about 650MB) that contains files
      at various offsets.  For instance, if a CD contains a 567 byte file named README, the ISO
      image might contain the README file's contents between offsets 20480000 and 20480567.  You can

      downloading, jigdo can re-use files on the old CD that are also
      present on the new image, and you do not need to download them
      again.  You found the secret message; you're a very careful

      under (e.g. `/mnt/cdrom'). Alternatively, just press enter if you

  already a file by that name in the current directory (the outdated image).  Jigdo-lite doesn't
  want to destroy that file, so it bails and lets me know that I can either delete that file or use

>Don't be timid about moving or renaming the image file just because it's loop mounted.  The

  the same.  You won't hurt the filesystem mounted under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt</TT
>.
  As for deleting the ISO file, that won't hurt the mounted filesystem either.  A file's inode gets
  deallocated only when the inode's reference count drops to zero.  Mounting the ISO image bumps the
  reference count up, so the file really gets deleted only after you <B

>Move the jigdo download directory up by as many directories as possible, closer to the

>The NTFS filesystem has a 255 character limit on a file's pathname.  When jigdo-lite
      downloads files from the internet, it makes a copy of the server directory structure in its
      download directory.  With their very long names, the above Debian packages may exceed the
      allowed path length, which leads to error messages like "<TT

>Early versions of jigdo-lite did not use it, but then some folks requested that

>--continue</TT
>" switch to avoid half-downloaded
      .deb files being ignored and deleted when you interrupt and restart jigdo-lite.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, it turned out that this led to problems: The Debian servers contained
      several identically named files (e.g. "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>root.bin</TT
>") in different directories,
      and if you interrupted jigdo-lite at roughly the right time during the download, the chances
      were high that the resumed download would append data to the wrong half-downloaded file,

>6.12. For image updates, I want jigdo-lite to scan 14
    loop-mounted images in one go.  How can I do this?</H2
><P
>When updating CD images, it's tiresome to keep loop-mounting and unmounting images.
      However, by default the Linux kernel only supports eight loop devices, and jigdo-lite's menu
      of previously entered paths only has five entries.</P
><P
>To scan many loop-mounted images, you must first tell the Linux kernel to support more
      than the default eight devices.  This is done by giving the "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>max_loop</TT
>"
      parameter to the module when loading it, e.g. with "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>modprobe loop
      max_loop=16</TT
>" on the command line or by adding the line "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>options loop
      max_loop=16</TT
>" to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/modules.conf</TT
>.  In Debian, you must put
      this line into a file named e.g. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/modutils/local-loop</TT
> and then run
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>update-modules</B
> because direct changes to
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/modules.conf</TT
> will be overwritten.</P
><P
>Having mounted the individual images, you can pass the parent directory of their mount
      points to jigdo-lite for scanning.  For example, if the images are mounted under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/myloopmounts/image1/</TT
> etc., pass "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/myloopmounts</TT
>" as the path to scan.  If passing the parent
      directory is inconvenient, you can also create a directory and fill it with symlinks to the
      mount points.</P

      <P

></LI
></UL
>

      </P
><P
>As Jens Seidel points out, there is another, rather crafty, source you should use for a
      scanning source: your apt cache.  Apt uses the directory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/cache/apt/archives</TT
> for cache.  There will be many Debian
      packages sitting in this directory, and they can be used for a scan source for
      <SPAN

      means, use this directory too.</P

>If you're editing the <TT

      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

      you'd try to avoid downloading these packages again.  For this reason, when downloading the
      new version of CD <TT

      <TT

      8 CD images, the cache will prevent all the data on the CDs from being read multiple
      times.</P
