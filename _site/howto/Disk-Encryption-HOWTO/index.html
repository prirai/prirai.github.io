>1. Introduction</H1
><P
>I've got a
    laptop computer running Linux and I don't want to
    worry about someone reading the personal information it contains, in case
    it gets lost or stolen. My log on password may stop someone from booting
    it, but it won't prevent an attacker from removing the hard disk and
    reading its data. I need stronger protection.</P
><P
>Fortunately, it's relatively easy to use encryption so the hard
    disk data would be unreadable if it were to fall into the wrong hands.
    Encryption's not only useful for portable computers like laptops&#8212;it
    can be used to protect any computer with personal information. I protect
    my computer's files with encryption for the same reason I lock my
    filing cabinet at home. For further motivation, you may be interested in
    reading Michael Crawford's <A
HREF="http://www.goingware.com/encryption/"
TARGET="_top"
>Why You Should Use Encryption</A
>.</P
><P
>I could encrypt only certain files, such as those in my home
    directory. This would protect the files but then I'd have to worry
    about information leaking out of them to other, unencrypted places on the
    disk. Instead I encrypt the whole disk so I don't have to manage this
    problem.</P
><P
>There are many encryption algorithms to choose from. I chose <A
HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/"
TARGET="_top"
>AES</A
> because it has
    been approved by the US government's <A
HREF="http://www.nist.gov/"
TARGET="_top"
>National
    Institute of Standards and Technology</A
> and is well regarded by the
    cryptography community. I want my use of it to be resistant to dictionary
    attacks, so I use a long, randomly generated key. There's no way
    I'm going to memorize such a key so I keep it in a form I can carry
    with me easily: on a USB flash drive on my keychain. I encrypt the key
    with a passphrase so my data is protected in two ways: by a) what I have
    (the USB flash drive) and b) what I know (the passphrase). I can even give
    a friend access to my computer without giving away my passphrase&#8212;she uses
    her own USB flash drive and her own passphrase.</P
><P
>The operating system keeps the data encrypted on the disk at all
    times and decrypts it in RAM only as it's used. This way if the
    computer loses power suddenly the data will remain protected. The
    decryption key is loaded into RAM at boot time and kept there while the
    computer is on, so I don't need to keep the USB flash drive plugged in
    after starting the computer.</P
><P
>The procedure outlined in this HOWTO is written for version 2.4 of
    the Linux kernel. It will become less complicated with the release of
    Linux 2.6, which will have built-in support for encryption and do a better
    job of managing partitions within loopback devices.</P
><P
>This document assumes the reader has a moderate level of experience
    with Linux (you should be comfortable <A

><P
>The encryption is implemented through a special kind of
      <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>loopback device</I
>. A loopback device doesn't
      store any data itself; instead it takes all the data storage and
      retrieval requests it receives and passes them along to a real storage
      device, such as a disk or a file. As the data passes through, it can be
      filtered, and in our case the filter used is encryption.</P
><P
>When the system is deployed, a removable medium (USB flash drive)
      boots using GRUB, a kernel, and an initrd. Both the key and the kernel
      are selected from the GRUB menu, allowing a single removable medium to
      be used with multiple computers. The initrd contains just enough tools
      to ask for a passphrase, set up an encrypted loopback device, and mount
      it. After mounting, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pivot_root</TT
> is used to resume the
      boot process from the encrypted device. Loopback device offsets are
      used, instead of partitions, to access separate swap and root file
      system spaces within the encrypted loopback device because the 2.4
      kernel doesn't provide access to partitions within loopback devices.
      The offset method does not generalize to multiple partitions
      (unfortunately) because the maximum offset understood by
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>losetup</TT
> is 2GB.</P

>1.6. Approaches</H2
><P
>There are three different approaches we can take to encrypt the
      disk: encrypt the whole thing, a single partition, or a single file. I
      strongly recommend the first approach for best security. The first two
      approaches assume you'll be booting from removable media, such as a
      USB flash drive or a business card size CD-ROM. If you don't want to
      do this, you may modify the method to boot from the disk instead by
      making a small, unencrypted boot partition. If you want to use a USB
      flash drive to boot your computer, be sure your motherboard can do it
      first. At the time of this writing many cannot.</P
><P
>To avoid having to enumerate all three approaches everywhere
      I'm going to refer to what you're protecting as the
      <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>asset</I
>. I will refer to the removable medium used
      to store the key as the <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>keychain</I
>. I call it the
      keychain instead of the key because we can store lots of keys, each for
      different computers, on the same medium.</P

>1.6.1. Whole Disk</H3
><P
>A problem with keeping data secret with encryption is that the
        data likes to move around. Imagine the encryption is like a fence
        around your data. While the data's inside the fence, it's
        safe. To be most useful, however, data likes to be transmitted on
        networks, put on removable disks like CD-ROMs, and shared with
        friends. Any time your data leaves the fenced area it's
        unprotected. We can't put an encryption fence around all possible
        locations where our data might play but we do want to make the fence
        as large as practical. By putting the encryption fence around your
        whole hard disk, you won't have to worry about data becoming
        unprotected if it jumps to another part of the disk.</P

>In this approach, we create one swap
        space and one root file system. Some people want more than a single
        encrypted partition for the root file system. Unfortunately, the
        method detailed here relies on the offset parameter of
        <TT
CLASS="literal"
>losetup</TT
> to create "subpartitions" within
        the asset. The offset parameter is limited to a maximum value of 2GB,
        limiting the size of all but the last partition to 2GB. This works
        nicely for swap, which is already limited to 2GB on the i386
        architecture, but I'm guessing it won't be practical for other
        uses. Using it to create multiple partitions smaller than 2GB is left
        as an exercise for the reader.</P
><P
>Another way to handle multiple partitions is to encrypt each partition separately (using the same key) to avoid the technical limitation above.  This isn't secure as encrypting the whole disk because the partition table is exposed.  When an attacker attempts to break encryption, the first thing he does is try to figure out what it's encrypting.  A partition table listing Linux partitions is a big hint.  For this reason I discourage encrypting multiple partitions separately, but arguably it's a good compromise for getting around the current <TT
CLASS="literal"
>losetup</TT
> limitation.  Another option is simply to wait for the release of Linux 2.6 because it is expected to make the offset parameter unnecessary.</P

>1.6.2. Partition (for multiboot systems)</H3
><P
>Encrypting the whole disk is fine if Linux is the only operating
        system on it, but this won't work for people who have set up their
        computer to boot multiple operating systems, e.g., <A
HREF="http://www.kernel.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux</A
>, <A
HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>NetBSD</A
>, and <A
HREF="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/"
TARGET="_top"
>Darwin</A
>. In this case
        we can encrypt just the Linux partition and leave the others alone.
        Since we're booting from a removable medium, we won't even
        need to include the Linux partition in the multiboot menu with the
        others. To see why this isn't as secure as encrypting the whole
        disk, read <A

>1.6.3. File (for home directories)</H3
><P
>You may want to encrypt only a file on a file system. Once
        you've encrypted it you can put into it whatever you want,
        including other file systems. You might want to use this approach to
        encrypt only your home directory, for example. This is the least
        secure of the three approaches and not recommended. If you choose this
        approach you will notice instructions below to skip whole sections.
        This is because I'm assuming you've already booted an
        operating system and have your swap issues handled, so those sections
        don't apply to you. This HOWTO may be overkill for your needs and
        you can probably get away with just reading the fine

><P
>In order to protect our asset well, we must first understand what
      we're protecting it against. The general idea is that you've got
      a laptop which is vulnerable to being stolen or lost, and have a USB
      flash drive on your keychain that isn't, so this system is designed
      to handle the case that your laptop is stolen. I'm guessing your
      keychain won't be as easily stolen because it's in your pocket,
      and because an attacker won't know that it's important. If you
      pull your USB flash drive out of your pocket and someone non-technical
      exclaims, "What's that?", tell them it's a <A

>This system falls short when it comes to <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>plausible
        deniability</I
>, which means there's no way to hide the
        fact that your personal data is encrypted. This is like locking your
        jewels in a safe and keeping the safe in plain sight in the middle of
        your living room. Only you can open the safe, but a man with a gun can
        tell you to open the safe for him. So if you're worried about your
        <A
HREF="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-11-502433.html?legacy=zdnn"
TARGET="_top"
>computer
        being subpoenaed</A
> and being told to hand over your laptop,
        keychain, and passphrase, you'd better look at other solutions
        such as <A
HREF="http://stegfs.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>StegFS</A
>.</P
><P
>The following solution to the deniability problem has been suggested by Norris Pouhovitch.
        It should be possible to install a minimal Windows partition at the front
        of the disk and to encrypt the remainder.  When the computer
        is turned on without the keychain, it boots Windows normally.  When the
        keychain is booted, it skips the Windows partition, decrypts the remainder of
        the disk, and boots Linux.</P
><P
>The advantage of this scheme is that if the laptop is stolen and turned
        on, it will look like what a casual attacker is expecting to see (a Windows
        computer).  On the other hand, a serious attacker could notice the unusually
        small partition and become suspicious.  I will flesh out this idea further in
        a future version of the HOWTO.</P

    the encryption is set up. It is possible to encrypt data in place, but for
    now I consider such magic too advanced for this HOWTO. See <A

>In the ideal setup you will use a bootable keychain device, such

      CD-ROM. This is because we want to expose as little of your disk as
      possible, but we're going to have to expose a minimal boot process
      or the computer will never start. Since the boot process will be
      necessarily unencrypted, it's better to have it away from your
      computer (on your keychain). If you can't or don't want to use a
      bootable keychain for some reason, then follow these instructions anyway
      but instead apply them to a small boot partition on your disk instead of
      the keychain.</P

>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or
      noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
      publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
      responsible for modifications made by others.</P
><P
>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
      derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
      sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
      copyleft license designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
      program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
      software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
      can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
      whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
      principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P

>A.2. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H1
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work, in
      any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
      it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice
      grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
      that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document",
      below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
      licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if
      you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
      under copyright law.</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document
      means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
      verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named
      appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals
      exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
      Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters)
      and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
      subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
      Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship
      could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with
      related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or
      political position regarding them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain
      Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
      Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is
      released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
      definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
      Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the
      Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short
      passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
      Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
      License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover
      Text may be at most 25 words.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document
      means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
      specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for
      revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or
      (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)
      some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
      text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
      suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
      Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been
      arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
      not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
      substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is
      called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed
      book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
      hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title
      page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
      "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance
      of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
      text.</P
><P
>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named
      subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains
      XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
      language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below,
      such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
      "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the
      Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it
      remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</P
><P
>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
      which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.</P

>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
      technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
      of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
      number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P

>A.4. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H1
><P
>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
      have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
      copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
      cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
      to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
      pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
      Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
      network-using public has access to download using public-standard
      network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
      added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
      prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
      to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
      stated location until at least one year after the last time you
      distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
      of that edition to the public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
      the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
      give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
      Document.</P

      Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
