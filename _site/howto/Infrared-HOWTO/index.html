>&#13;The Infrared-HOWTO provides an introduction to Linux and
infrared devices and how to use the software provided by the Linux/IrDA
project. This package uses IrDA(TM) compliant standards. IrDA(TM) is an
industrial standard for infrared wireless communication, and most laptops made
after January 1996 are equipped with an IrDA(TM) compliant infrared
transceiver. Infrared ports let you communicate with printers, modems, fax
machines, LANs, and other laptops or PDAs. Speed ranges from 2400bps to 4Mbps.
</P
><P
>&#13;The Linux/IrDA stack supports IrLAP, IrLMP, IrIAS, IrIAP, IrLPT, IrCOMM,
IrOBEX, and IrLAN. Several of the protocols are implemented as both clients
and servers. There is also support for multiple IrLAP connections, via
several IrDA(TM) devices at once. The Linux/IrDA project started at the end
of 1997 and experienced some major rewrites since then. Please don't expect every
feature working straight yet. As far as I know Linux/IrDA is the only open source IrDA
implementation available.
</P
><P
>&#13;Remote Control (RC) via infrared is the aim of the 
Linux Infrared Remote Control - LIRC project, and also described in this HOWTO.

>&#13;   The project started at the end of 1997 with the name Linux/IrDA. Due
   to some troubles with the name IrDA, which is trademarked by the
   Infrared Data Association IrDA , the name was changed to Linux/IR. At
   the end of 1998 the relationship between both became better and
   the name was changed to Linux/IrDA again. Since February 1999 the
   project is an official member of IrDA .

>&#13;   Some caveats in the documentation have been caused by changes of the following
   concepts, device names and parameters. I hope I have got them alright now, they confused me
   sometimes, too. The new style stuff works from Kernel 2.2.15 / 2.4.0.
   Some important changes were made again in Kernel 2.6, not all of these are
   mentioned in this document yet, I will fix that hopefully soon.
   Anyway I recommend not to use any earlier kernel version than 2.6.
   This document will describe
   differences to the kernel 2.4 series in the appropriate places
   to provide documentation for situations where you must
   use kernel 2.4, which is hopefully rare.
   
   You should always use current Kernel, irda-utils and documentation.

</P
><P
>&#13;   One advantage of implementing IrDA device drivers as network device
   drivers is that you should be able to attach sniffers to the device
   (or actually the packet type). That way, it is possible to use a
   really handy utility called irdadump (instead of tcpdump). This will
   make debugging MUCH easier. Linux-2.2 implements the BPF (Berkeley
   Packet Filter), so its possible to filter out exactly the frames you
   want to see.

> . CONFIG_PACKET
   has to be enabled in the kernel. If compiled as a module you might
   load the module manually. <B
CLASS="command"

   has been converted into a library,

>2.2.3.1. IrDA subsystem support</H3
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRDA
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrDA (TM) protocols.
  The Infrared Data Associations (tm) specifies standards for wireless
  infrared communication and is supported by most laptops and PDA's.
</P
><P
>&#13;  To use Linux support for the IrDA (tm) protocols, you will also need
  some user-space utilities like irattach
  . For more information, see the file
  Documentation/networking/irda.txt. You also want to read the
  InfraRed-HOWTO, available at 
  <A
HREF="http://tuxmobil.org/howtos.html"
TARGET="_top"
>TuxMobil</A
>
  .
</P
><P
>&#13;  This support is also available as a module called irda.o. If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.
</P
><P
>&#13;IrDA Cache last LSAP
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRDA_CACHE_LAST_LSAP
  Say Y here if you want IrLMP to cache the last LSAP used. This makes
  sense since most frames will be sent/received on the same
  connection. Enabling this option will save a hash-lookup per frame.
</P
><P
>&#13;  If unsure, say Y.
</P
><P
>&#13;IrDA Fast RR's
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRDA_FAST_RR
  Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames
  when acting as a primary station. This will make IrLAP send out a RR
  frame immediately when receiving a frame if its own transmit queue
  is currently empty. This will give a lot of speed improvement when
  receiving much data since the secondary station will not have to
  wait the max. turn around time before it is allowed to transmit the
  next time. If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty the
  primary will back off waiting longer for sending out the RR frame
  until the timeout reaches the normal value. Enabling this option
  will make the IR-diode burn more power and thus reduce your battery
  life.
</P
><P
>&#13;  If unsure, say N.
</P
><P
>&#13;IrDA Debug
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRDA_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you want the IrDA subsystem to write debug information
  to your syslog. You can change the debug level in
  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/proc/sys/net/irda/debug</TT
>
</P
><P
>&#13;  If unsure, say Y (since it makes it easier to find the bugs).
</P
><P
>&#13;IrLAP Compression support
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRDA_COMPRESSION
  Compression is _not_ part of the IrDA(tm) protocol specification,
  but it's working great! Linux is the first to try out compression
  support at the IrLAP layer. This means that you will only benefit
  from compression if you are running a Linux &#60;-&#62; Linux configuration.
</P
><P
>&#13;  If you say Y here, you also need to say Y or M to a compression
  protocol below.
</P
><P
>&#13;IrLAP Deflate Compression Protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRDA_DEFLATE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Deflate compression
  protocol. The deflate compression (GZIP) is exactly
  the same as the one used by the PPP protocol. 
</P
><P
>&#13;  If you want to compile this compression support as a module, say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called
  irda_deflate.o.
</P
><P
>&#13;IrLAN Protocol 
   But currently the IrLAN protocol is no longer maintained
   by the Linux/IrDA core team.
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRLAN
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrLAN protocol. If
  you want to compile it as a module (irlan.o), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. IrLAN emulates an Ethernet and makes it
  possible to put up a wireless LAN using infrared beams.
</P
><P
>&#13;  The IrLAN protocol can be used to talk with infrared access points 
  like the HP NetbeamIR, or the ESI JetEye NET. You can also connect 
  to another Linux machine running the IrLAN protocol for ad-hoc 
  networking!
</P
><P
>&#13;IrCOMM Protocol
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRCOMM
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrCOMM protocol. If
  you want to compile it as a module (you will get <B
CLASS="command"
>ircomm.o</B
> and
  <B
CLASS="command"
>ircomm-tty.o</B
>), say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrCOMM
  implements serial port emulation, and makes it possible to use all
  existing applications that understands TTY's with an infrared link.
  Thus you should be able to use application like PPP, minicom and
  others. Enabling this option will create two modules called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>ircomm</TT
>
  and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>ircomm-tty</TT
>.

>&#13;IrTTY IrDA Device Driver
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRTTY_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
  discipline. If you want to compile it as a module (irtty.o), say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrTTY makes it possible to
  use Linux's own serial driver for all IrDA ports that are 16550
  compatible. Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you should
  probably say Y to this option. Using IrTTY will however limit the
  speed of the connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode)
</P
><P
>&#13;  If unsure, say Y.
</P
><P
>&#13;IrPORT IrDA Device Driver
</P
><P
>&#13;CONFIG_IRPORT_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrPORT IrDA device
  driver. If you want to compile it as a module (irport.o), say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrPORT can be used instead of
  IrTTY and sometimes this can be better. One example is if your IrDA
  port does not have echo-canceling, which will work OK with IrPORT
  since this driver is working in half-duplex mode only. You don't
  need to use <B
CLASS="command"
>irattach</B
> with IrPORT, but you just insert it the same
  way as FIR drivers (<B
CLASS="command"
>insmod irport io=0x3e8 irq=11</B
>). Notice that
  IrPORT is a SIR device driver which means that speed is limited to
  115200 bps.

>&#13;From Florian Lohoff 
You should also set "port 0x0 irq 0" otherwise you will see interesting
effects if there is suddenly a different S1 e.g. by inserting
a modem PCMCIA card. The serial driver will then touch
the OLD ports without having acquired those which will cause
the irda stuff to die/hang. This is a bug i havent been able
to find in the serial driver but it definitly
exists (Put a printk into the serial_out serial_in stuff).

   If this is not the case, you either don't have infrared support
   enabled in the BIOS or the SIR mode of your infrared device is not
   detected by the kernel. Currently I know only two laptop models
   with this effect, the HP OmniBook 800 and the Toshiba Libretto
   models. I am not sure whether PnP support effects the detection of
   the IR port. If you are unsure try it out and let me know the
   results. Maybe you can use FIR mode if SIR doesn't work.

   4Mbps they have to use 4PPM (4 pulse position) modulation technique.
   A list of supported FIR chips is included in

   You may start the FIR

   it is possible to have two serial ports using different dongles at the
   same time (so the tty you are binding must know which dongle it is
   supposed to use). So if you have two dongles and two serial ports, you
   could do something like this:

   PS: I would not try to turn the two dongles against each other, since
   I really don't know how the stack would react :-) ... Since I don't
   have any of these new ACTiSYS 220L+ dongles, I'm not able to test it.
   Since the new dongle has support for one extra speed (38400bps), you
   must specify the dongles differently with 
   <B
CLASS="command"
>irattach</B
> so that the kernel
   knows which dongle you are using (and what QoS can be used):

   The current implementation of dongle support does not have any state
   associated with it, so its not possible to use both ACTiSYS dongles
   (220L and 220L+) at the same time (connected to two serial ports) for
   now. If someone needs to be able to do so, please mail me (Dag
   Brattli) and I will think about it!"

   infrared support in the BIOS to get it working!

   Basically any IrDA compatible transceiver will work (I have a stack of
   old IRM3001 these are now obselete) you need to hook a capacitor (use
   a tantalum about ~1uF) between 5V and 0V near the transceiver and then
   connect everthing else up 
   (RX-&#62;RX, TX-&#62;TX, 5V-&#62;5V, and 0V-0V). If you
   don't like soldering irons, lots of companies do sell IR modules for
   the 5 pin connectors that fit into a hole in your case.

   I managed to establish an apparently robust connection between
   my Linux box and a Palm III. The pppd invocation I use is as
   follows:

   Strange is however the fact that discovery must be enabled (maybe
   obsolete) . Otherwise, even with an active IrCOMM connection, the
   link goes down due to a IrLAP disconnect.
   The pilot-link tools (used for Linux/Palm synchronization) also
   ran flawlessly over IrCOMM via <TT

</P

>&#13;   This will tell you how to set up a masqueraded PPP connection via.
   IrDA from WinCE to a Linux based notebook computer. Once you are IP
   connected, the rest is up to you. We put this together as a guide for
   Sony notebook users with Casio E-100/105 PDA's, though the procedure
   should work for any WinCE 2.11 device with infrared capabilities
   talking to any notebook. Do all the Linux side testing signed on as
   root, standard warnings apply.
</P
><P
>&#13;Configure WinCE

   Configure a network connection for your WinCE device. Go into
   "Connections" and create a "Direct Connection" Name it something
   meaningful, for device select "Infrared Port". Go into settings and
   change the baud rate to 115200, this is the max for WinCE. Go to
   TCP/IP settings and check "Use server-assigned IP address," and "Use
   software compression," and "Use IP header compression" Make sure "Use
   Slip," is unchecked. For Name Servers, make sure "Use server-assigned
   addresses" is checked. Go to Start, Settings, Communications,
   Identification and enter something for the Device Name. (I used
   "cetoy") You most likely already have these values set if you have
   synced with a Win9x desktop using Activesynch.
</P
><P
>&#13;Configure Linux/IrDA

   Set up IrDA support on your notebook (described elsewhere) and get to
   the point where your notebook will discover an IrDA compliant device.
   A good sign is the irda0 device will show up when you execute
   ifconfig. It will not have an IP address, this is ok.
</P

>&#13;Setup the Connection

   Test the discovery by setting an IrDA device in range of your IR port,
   wait 5 seconds, and;

   Your WinCE machine will not be discovered unless it's actively looking

   The name displayed will be whatever value you have entered into the
   Start, Settings, Communications, Identification as the Device Name. At
   this point, with basic IrDA functioning- we can move on to
   establishing a PPP connection for WinCE. These scripts can also be
   used for serial cable connects. Create the following files and copy
   them into the directory indicated.

   The following file will allow you to specify the IP addresses, IR (or
   serial port if using a cable) device, DNS and so forth. I do not
   recommend you change the 192.IP addresses below. WinCE really has an
   affection for 192.168.55.100 because all the MS synch tools seem to
   have it hardcoded. DNS can be whatever you normally use.

   Ok, now you can test the connection to make sure it all works. Reboot
   your machine, run irattach /dev/ttyS2 -s (/dev/ttyS2 being the
   serial port your BIOS sees the IR device as, if irattach is not
   running, start it) Align the IR ports, at the Linux command prompt
   type /usr/sbin/cebox.sh, and simultaneously press return to start
   cebox and double tap your connection icon in WinCE. You should get a
   happy message from WinCE reporting Connecting to Host, Device
   Connected, Authenticating User, User Authenticated and finally
   Connected. You should see something like this when you are connected:

   The following script sets up IrDA, establishes a ppp connection with
   WinCE, and then sets up IP masquerading. It is provided as an example
   of how you can tie this all together. This is more or less a manual
   approach. You can get creative, start irattach at boot and stick a
   line in inittab to constantly look for a WinCE connection on the IR
   port. This will however, run down your batteries and limit your
   ability to access other IR gadgets. I just use the script below.
   Position the device, run wince and start communications on your PDA
   when the script tells you to.

>&#13;   ... OK, I sort of worked it out. By using TIOCSTI on /dev/console, you

   problem for virtual consoles that expect to receive some translated

   work quite nice when using X but not for other virtual consoles.
   Anyway this is good enough for me, so I will not use a lot of time
   converting the scancodes to keycodes and index them with some keymap
   just to make it work with text only virtual consoles. As I see it the

   Sharp says that IrDA-D and IrDA-C can coexist -- as long as both of

>IrDA hardware survey at TuxMobil</A

   . This list also
   contains information about infrared capable devices which are not
   mentioned here (mice, printers, remote control, transceivers,
   etc.).
   To make this hardware survey more valuable it is necessary to
   collect more information about the infrared devices in different
   hardware. You can help by sending me a short e-mail containing the
   exact name of the hardware you have and which type of infrared
   controller is used.
   Please let me also know how well Linux/IrDA worked, at which tty,
   port and interrupt it works and the corresponding infrared device
   (e.g. printer, cellular phone) you use.
   You can also help by contributing detailed technological
   information about some infrared devices, which is necessary to
   develope an according driver for Linux.

>4.6. IrDA and USB</H1
><P
>&#13;   The IrDA USB driver is included in recent 2.4 kernels. It's not as 
   efficient as    other FIR hardware, but at least is supported and 
   is relatively easy to get working. Also, all the current 
   products are based on the same hardware, and we know most of its bugs.
</P
><P
>&#13;   As far as I know the Actisys 2000U and Extended System ESI-9685
   dongles seem to be based on the same hardware.
   Both USB dongles work fine with the Linux driver. It's possible to
   have multiple USB dongles in a box (for now, only up to 4).
</P
><P
>&#13;   The latest version of the driver has been tested with 
   <B
CLASS="command"
>usb-uhci</B
> and <B
CLASS="command"
>usb-ohci</B
>.
   see also driver infos in src e.g. USB 2.0
</P
><P
>&#13;   There is an USB IrDA Bridge Device spec at Rev 0.9B , it's being
   adopted as an USB class specification. You can find it at under 0.9
   Class Specification header at
   <A
HREF="http://www.usb.org"
TARGET="_top"
>USB.org</A
>
   .
</P
><P
>&#13;   Recently a new type of USB dongle from SigmaTel has appeared on
   the market which is _not_ compliant with the IrDA-USB
   specification, and therefore doesn't work with this driver. On the
   other hand, SigmaTel has made available the 
   <A
HREF="http://www.sigmatel.com/technical_docs.htm#wireless"
TARGET="_top"
>full technical specification</A
>
   , so writing a driver for it is possible.

</P
><P
>&#13;   You need a working USB controller. Check whether the appropriate module
   is already inserted with <B

   it with <B

>&#13;   The following is based on my experience with the 
   <A
HREF="http://www.sharp-world.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>SHARP</A
>
   Zaurus SL-5500G, with the original SHARP romimage 2.38G and 
   Kernel 2.4.6-rmk1-np2-embedix#1,
   but may be applied mutatis mutandis to other Linux PDAs.
   The Zaurus comes with a written manual, where beaming files and PPP connections
   are explained using the GUI (e.g. FileManager, Settings). 
   Here I will try to cover what can be done
   from the command line and topics neither included in the official SHARP manual nor the
   <A
HREF="http://www.rit.edu/~tfs1812/opieusermanual/book1.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>Opie User Manual</A
>
   
   .
   The infrared functions seem to be part of the StrongARM SA1110 CPU, the
   IrDA driver module is named <B
CLASS="command"
>sa1110_ir</B
> (on the stock
   Zaurus IrDA support seems to be built into the Kernel). From the
   <B
CLASS="command"
>irda-utils</B
> only <B
CLASS="command"
>irattach</B
> is
   available. IrDA support is attached via <B
CLASS="command"
>irattach /dev/ttyS2 -s 1</B
>
   (note "-s 1" will be replaced by "-s" with newer versions). So it looks like 
   SIR is used, I don't have information about FIR support yet.
   To get some of the functionality of <B
CLASS="command"
>irdadump</B
> and
   detect other IrDA devices in range or debug IrDA you may use 
   <B
CLASS="command"
>cat /proc/net/irda/discovery</B
> and the other 
   files in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/proc</TT
> filesystem or compile
   the <B
CLASS="command"
>irda-utils</B
> for the ARM archictecture by yourself,
   also pre-compiled binaries are available.
   From the device files only <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/ircomm</TT
> (note 
   it's not <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/ircomm0</TT
>) is
   created by default. The file <TT
CLASS="filename"
>modules.conf</TT
> doesn't
   seem to exist. With <B
CLASS="command"
>irrecv</B
> you may start the infrared
   GUI settings. IrOBEX support is available, but the appropriate tools from
   <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openobex/"
TARGET="_top"
>OpenOBEX</A
>
   are missing, but you may beam files to a Palm PDA, cell phone or
   another Linux box or a Microsoft-Windows machine from the GUI.
   The IrDA startup scripts lives in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home/etc/rc.d/init.d/irda</TT
>.
   For infrared remote control support see below.

>4.7.2. Beaming Files - OpenOBEX</H2

>&#13;   The advantage of OBEX is usually the integration. Send an
   appointement event over OBEX, and most likely the Zaurus will
   integrate that in the built-in calendar automagically, like the Palm
   does. Same for business cards.

   "The Zaurus doesn't support the "OBEX:IrXfer" service, it

   <B

   It is confirmed to work well with Siemens S45/ME45 and similar mobile phones.

   esd is running. The reason is that esd makes the soundcard give
   interrups over 300 times/second which makes the serial driver
   overrun when receiving. This is because the serial driver now uses
   slow interrupts in Linux-2.2 (everything is slow interrupts in
   2.2), so the interrupt-handler schedules on its way out. The good
   thing about slow interrupts is that packets are delivered much
   faster, since you don't need to wait for the next timer-tick. The
   only exception for this is the pc87108 driver which works fine
   since it uses DMA and will only give a couple of interrupts per

   increase receiver sensitivity. In order to extend the link distance,
   both sensitivity and intensity must be increased for both ends of the
   IR link. If it is desired to communicate with a standard IrDA device

   must be increased. The standard IrDA device may also have minimum
   receiver sensitivity, so transmitter intensity must also be
   increased."

>&#13;New IrDA Protocol Development

   AIR is pushed mainly by IBM. You get wider angle and longer distance
   (10M?) but may be at lower data rate. You can also time-multiplex this
   already slow channel. In my opinion the benefit to the user is very
   little. AIR hardware and software changes are costly. I think you will
   have to wait for a long time, if ever, to see any product using AIR.
</P
><P
>&#13;   IrBUS is pushed mainly by Sharp. It is aimed at remote control, IR
   keyboard, etc., not for data communication. I think if Sharp succeed,
   you may see IrBUS in set-top boxes, web-tv, etc. If and when these
   devices reaches a critical mass, some PC may incorporate IrBUS in
   order to control these devices.
</P
><P
>&#13;   VFIR is the latest. The benefit is higher data rate (16 Mbps). Unlike
   AIR and IrBUS, the software changes for VFIR are minimum. The changes
   are mainly in hardware.
</P
><P
>&#13;   In summary, I do not think we need to wait in anticipation of new IrDA
   protocols. A easy to install and solid implementation of the existing
   IrDA protocols is the cutting edge!.

><P
>&#13;   Q1 - Question: I do not know anything about ports and irqs. What
   should I do?
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Answer:
   PART A: Hardware settings
   - 1 Have a look at your hardware specs!!! If not available look at
   the support page of your vendor, or contact the support hotline.
   You might also find the information in one of the hardware surveys
   mentioned above.

   PART B: How to tell the kernel about the hardware settings
   -4 cat /proc/ioports to see which ports are already in use.
   -5 cat /proc/interrupts to see which interrupts are already in
   use.
   -6 Make ports and interrupts available for use with the IR device,
   e.g. stop the PCMCIA service or include a line like this in
   /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia: PCIC_OPTS="irq_list=3,4,5,7,9,10,12,14,15"
   -7 Now try to guess what the right interrupt and port is. Use
   setserial /dev/ttySx irq M port 0xNNNN to tell the kernel. If
   there is more then one possible chance try them all (Note: As
   mentioned in the Serial-HOWTO you should not try irq 0, 1, 6, 8,
   13, 14).
   -8 If you were successful please send these parameters to the
   author, because I would like to include them in the Infrared
   Hardware Survey.
   -9 Good luck.
   It might also be necessary to fine tune the IR serial port with
   setserial, e.g., setserial /dev/ttyS0 spd_vhi (speed rate 115200).

>&#13;   Q7 - Question by Ho Chin Keong: Is there other way of setting up

</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Answer by Dag Brattli: Yes and no! One of the IrDA standard,
   IrCOMM permits you to emulate a serial cable between two laptops,
   so you can use any application written for serial ports
   (terminals, PPP, slip, etc.). This is however not yet implemented
   in Linux/IrDA. The IrLPT (printer) support is actually a subset of
   IrCOMM, so some of it is working!
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Q8 - Question by Ho Chin Keong: If I block the infrared path
   deliberately for more than 10 seconds, the connection could not
   re-establish. I have to kill the irattach and restart the whole
   procedure to start the infrared route. The connection could be
   maintained, however, if the blocking is less than 10 seconds. Is
   this part of the design or a bug? Is there any way whereby we can
   lengthen this time limit from 10 s to longer or infinitely?
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;   Answer by Thomas Davis: This seems to be a bug in the primary side
   of the IrLAP/IrLMP code. It appears not to send the
   reset/disconnect notice all the way back up the stack. You'll
   notice it when IrLPT gets stuck in the query mode while you were
   trying to talk to a printer, and disconnected/interrupted it when
   it was handshaking. (and now, it shows up in the IrLAN portion)

>&#13;Q12 - By Rui Oliveira: I am having a problem connecting a PalmIII
   to a Linux box with an Actisys 220L adapter. With a motherboard
   adapter (no brand but, I think, similar to the Actisys 210L) I
   simply redirect a pilot syncronization tool (pilot-xfer) to
   /dev/ttyS1 which has the ir adapter attached and, using IrLink in
   SIR mode, I can get the Linux box to talk with the PalmIII. Trying
   the above through a serial port with a serial-irda Actisys 220L
   adapter I can't get this to work. My question is :What happens if
   one just throws data into a serial port with a irda adapter?

</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Answer by Lichen Wang: In terms of hardware, IrDA SIR needs a
   serializer- deserializer, an encoder-decoder, and a transceiver.
   The UART that drives the COM port of any PC is a
   serializer-deserializer. In some PC, there is also an
   encoder-decoder which can be enabled or disabled by the BIOS. When
   it is disabled, the COM port is usable as an old COM port. When
   the encoder-decoder is enabled, usually the COM port is no longer
   usable but an IrDA port is now usable instead. Actisys IR-210 is a
   SIR transceiver and thus can be used if the PC has this kind of
   UART with an IrDA encoder-decoder and the BIOS has enabled it.
   Under this hardware configuration, you need to tell the Windows
   setup program that you have "standard infrared devices" and with
   "Built-in Infrared port on laptop or desktop". Actisys IR-220, on
   the other hand, includes both the encoder-decoder and the
   transceiver. It is designed to be used with a regular UART. If the
   UART in the PC has also the encoder-decoder built-in, you must use
   BIOS to disable that. Under either of this hardware configuration,
   you need to tell the Windows setup program that you have an
   "ACTiSYS" manufactured "ACT-IR220L Infrared Wireless Interface".
   To answer your question: In addition to throwing data at the
   serial port, you need to tell the UART and the encoder-decoder
   what data rate to use. In the case of a built-in encoder-decoder,
   when you set the data rate of the UART, the encoder-decode also
   get set correctly. In the case a separate encoder-decoder, you
   need to tell both of them the data rate separatly.

</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Answer by Dag Brattli: If you still have Win95 on your machine,
   you should go to the device manager and change the PnP setup for
   the IrDA port (something else than the stuff your're already
   using). You could for example move away ttyS1 (in Win95), so that
   it uses the values that the PCMCIA card is going to steal, and
   then use the settings from ttyS1 for ttyS2.

>LIRC</A
>
   is a package that supports receiving and sending IR signals of
   the most common IR remote controls. It contains a device driver for
   hardware connected to the serial port, a daemon that decodes and sends
   IR signals using this device driver, a mouse daemon that translates IR
   signals to mouse movements and a couple of user programs that allow to
   control your computer with a remote control. The IR hardware can be
   either selfmade or choosen from a variety of commercial solutions.
   Takahide Higuchi wrote about LIRC: "It's great, and it seems almost
   complete solution, but it seems there is almost nothing supporting
   hardware on the market (or need to solder some special circuit ... it
   is hard work for many people to do so). I believe that LIRC will be
   more popular if consumer IR support is implemented in FastIR drivers
   and some common API (for example, a raw IrSocket and common ioctls) is
   made!".

>Appendix D. Infrared Light and Eye Safety</H1
><P
>&#13;   This section summarizes some ideas and thoughts that were exchanged on the
   Linux/IrDA mailing list. It is not medically well-founded, and whoever has
   better evidence or some more well-founded source of information is
   encouraged to contribute it to this HOWTO.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The IrDA spec says that the range of IrDA devices has been limited to 1m for
   reasons of eye safety. Another plausible assumption is that power
   consumption and IR pollution/crosstalk were reasons for this limitation. In
   principle there could be danger for the eye, because infrared light is not
   registered by the eye, and thus the pupil won't close in order to protect
   the retina from bright IR light sources. This is the same situation as with
   UV light, which will cause snow blindness eventually, but in contrast to UV
   light, IR light contains much less harmful energy due to its longer
   wavelength.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The only legal restrictions and medical advices we were able to find on
   the web were concerned with infrared emissions of heat lamps or in the
   welding process and IEC 825-1 (CENELEC EN60825-1). This suggests that IR
   light as emitted by IrDA devices will be harmless, since even the peak
   power emitted by strong IR LEDs (ca. 300mW) is several orders of
   magnitude below the power emitted by medical IR heat lamps (up to 500W).
   For these, however, you are supposed to wear protective goggles, so
   maybe if you are looking straight into 1.000 infrared LEDs flashing at
   once, you should do so, too. The effect of infrared light is mostly
   heat, though, and not an alteration or destruction of the biological
   cell structure, such as caused by UV light. Though in the specs for the
   HP OmniBook 800 Hewlett-Packard recommends not to look directly into the
   IR LED.
</P
><P
>&#13;   As stated above, this discussion is only based on guesswork and common
   sense assumptions about the data found in IR LED and heat lamp specs.
   If anybody with a better medical knowledge can comment on this, please
   do so!

input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque". 
</P
><P
>&#13;Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML
produced by some word processors for output purposes only. 
</P
><P
>&#13;The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

>E.3.3. 2. VERBATIM COPYING</H2
><P
>&#13;You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,
the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. 
</P

>E.3.4. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H2
><P
>&#13;If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover,
and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on
the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network
location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public
has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must
take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. 
</P
><P
>&#13;It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these
things in the Modified Version: 
</P
><P
>&#13;     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as
     a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</P
><P
>&#13;     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
     less than five).
</P
><P
>&#13;     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
     publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
     and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in
     the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the
     Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
     equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. 
</P
><P
>&#13;     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add
their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other
section titles. 
</P
><P
>&#13;You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
definition of a standard. 
</P
><P
>&#13;You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to
the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same
cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. 
</P

>&#13;The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section
unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
combined work.

storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the other
self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

>&#13;If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
