>2. Introduction to Linux Loadable Kernel Modules</H1
><P
>If you want to add code to a Linux kernel, the most basic way to do
that is to add some source files to the kernel source tree and
recompile the kernel.  In fact, the kernel configuration process
consists mainly of choosing which files to include in the kernel to be
compiled.</P
><P
>But you can also add code to the Linux kernel while it is running.  A
chunk of code that you add in this way is called a loadable kernel
module.  These modules can do lots of things, but they typically are
one of three things: 1) device drivers; 2) filesystem drivers; 3)
system calls.  The kernel isolates certain functions, including these,
especially well so they don't have to be intricately wired into the
rest of the kernel.</P

>2.1. Terminology</H2
><P
>Loadable kernel modules are often called just kernel modules or just
modules, but those are rather misleading terms because there are lots
of kinds of modules in the world and various pieces built into the
base kernel can easily be called modules.  We use the term loadable
kernel module or LKM for the particular kinds of modules this HOWTO is
about.</P
><P
>Some people think of LKMs as outside of the kernel.  They speak of
LKMs communicating with the kernel.  This is a mistake; LKMs (when
loaded) are very much part of the kernel.  The correct term for the
part of the kernel that is bound into the image that you boot, i.e.
all of the kernel <EM
>except</EM
> the LKMs, is "base
kernel."  LKMs communicate with the base kernel.</P
><P
>In some other operating systems, the equivalent of a Linux LKM is
called a "kernel extension."</P
><P
>Now what is "Linux"?  Well, first of all, the name is used for
two entirely different things, and only one of them is really relevant
here:
<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>The kernel and related items distributed as a package by Linus Torvalds.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A class of operating systems that traditionally are based on the Linux
kernel.</P
></LI
></OL
></P
><P
>Only the first of these is really useful in discussing LKMs.  But even
choosing this definition, people are often confused when it comes to
LKMs.  Is an LKM part of Linux or not?  Though an LKM is always part
of the kernel, it is part of Linux if it is distributed in the Linux
kernel package, and not otherwise.  Thus, if you have loaded into your
kernel a device driver LKM that came with your device, you can't,
strictly speaking, say that your kernel is Linux.  Rather, it's a
slight extension of Linux.

As you might expect, it is commonplace to use the name "Linux"
approximately -- Lots of variations on Linux are in use and are widely
distributed, and referred to as "Linux."  In this document, 
though, we will stick to the strictest definition in the interest of 
clarity.&#13;</P

>2.2. History of Loadable Kernel Modules</H2
><P
>LKMs did not exist in Linux in the beginning.  Anything we use an LKM
for today was built into the base kernel at kernel build time instead.
LKMs have been around at least since Linux 1.2 (1995).</P
><P
>Device drivers and such were always quite modular, though.  When LKMs
were invented, only a small amount of work was needed on these modules
to make them buildable as LKMs.  However, it had to be done on each
and every one, so it took some time.  Since about 2000, virtually
everything that makes sense as an LKM has at least had the option of
being an LKM.</P

>2.3. The Case For Loadable Kernel Modules</H2
><P
>You often have a choice between putting a module into the kernel by
loading it as an LKM or binding it into the base kernel.  LKMs have a 
lot of advantages over binding into the base kernel and I recommend
them wherever possible.</P
><P
>One advantage is that you don't have to rebuild your kernel as often.
This saves you time and spares you the possibility of introducing an
error in rebuilding and reinstalling the base kernel.  Once you have a
working base kernel, it is good to leave it untouched as long as
possible.</P
><P
>Another advantage is that LKMs help you diagnose system problems.  A
bug in a device driver which is bound into the kernel can stop your
system from booting at all.  And it can be really hard to tell which
part of the base kernel caused the trouble.  If the same device driver
is an LKM, though, the base kernel is up and running before the device
driver even gets loaded.  If your system dies after the base kernel is
up and running, it's an easy matter to track the problem down to the
trouble-making device driver and just not load that device driver
until you fix the problem.</P
><P
>LKMs can save you memory, because you have to have them loaded
only when you're actually using them.  All parts of the base kernel stay
loaded all the time.  And in real storage, not just virtual storage.</P
><P
>LKMs are much faster to maintain and debug.  What would require a full
reboot to do with a filesystem driver built into the kernel, you can
do with a few quick commands with LKMs.  You can try out different
parameters or even change the code repeatedly in rapid succession,
without waiting for a boot.</P
><P
>LKMs are not slower, by the way, than base kernel modules.  Calling
either one is simply a branch to the memory location where it resides.

><P
>Sometimes you <EM

> to build something into the
base kernel instead of making it an LKM.  Anything that is necessary
to get the system up far enough to load LKMs must obviously be built
into the base kernel.  For example, the driver for the disk drive that
contains the root filesystem must be built into the base kernel.</P

>2.4. What LKMs Can't Do</H2
><P
>There is a tendency to think of LKMs like user space programs.  They
do share a lot of their properties, but LKMs are definitely not user
space programs.  They are part of the kernel.  As such, they have free
run of the system and can easily crash it.  </P

>2.5. What LKMs Are Used For</H2
><P
>There are six main things LKMs are used for:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Device drivers.  A device driver is designed for a specific piece of
hardware.  The kernel uses it to communicate with that piece of
hardware without having to know any details of how the hardware works.
For example, there is a device driver for ATA disk drives.  There is
one for NE2000 compatible Ethernet cards.  To use any device, the
kernel must contain a device driver for it.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Filesystem drivers.  A filesystem driver interprets the contents of a
filesystem (which is typically the contents of a disk drive) as files
and directories and such.  There are lots of different ways of storing
files and directories and such on disk drives, on network servers, and
in other ways.  For each way, you need a filesystem driver.  For
example, there's a filesystem driver for the ext2 filesystem type used
almost universally on Linux disk drives.  There is one for the MS-DOS
filesystem too, and one for NFS.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>System calls.  User space programs use system calls to get services
from the kernel.  For example, there are system calls to read a file,
to create a new process, and to shut down the system.  Most system
calls are integral to the system and very standard, so are always
built into the base kernel (no LKM option).  But you can invent a
system call of your own and install it as an LKM.  Or you can decide
you don't like the way Linux does something and override an existing
system call with an LKM of your own.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Network drivers.  A network driver interprets a network protocol.  It
feeds and consumes data streams at various layers of the kernel's
networking function.  For example, if you want an IPX link in your
network, you would use the IPX driver.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>TTY line disciplines.  These are essentially augmentations of device
drivers for terminal devices.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Executable interpreters.  An executable interpreter loads and runs an
executable.  Linux is designed to be able to run executables in
various formats, and each must have its own executable interpreter.</P

>3. Making Loadable Kernel Modules</H1
><P
>An LKM lives in a single ELF object file (normally named like
"serial.o").  You typically keep all your LKM object files in a
particular directory (near your base kernel image makes sense).  When
you use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> program to insert an LKM into
the kernel, you give the name of that object file.</P
><P
>For the LKMs that are part of Linux, you build them as part of the
same kernel build process that generates the base kernel image.  See
the README file in the Linux source tree.  In short, after you make
the base kernel image with a command such as 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make zImage</B
>, 
you will make all the LKMs with the command

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>This results in a bunch of LKM object files (*.o) throughout the Linux
source tree.  (In older versions of Linux, there would be symbolic
links in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>modules</TT
> directory of the Linux source
tree pointing to all those LKM object files).  These LKMs are ready to
load, but you probably want to install them in some appropriate
directory.  The conventional place is described in <A
HREF="#MODLOCATION"
>Section 5.6</A
>.  The command
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make modules_install</B
>
will copy them all over to the conventional locations.</P
><P
>Part of configuring the Linux kernel (at build time) is choosing which
parts of the kernel to bind into the base kernel and which parts to
generate as separate LKMs.  In the basic question-and-answer
configuration (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make config</B
>), you are asked, for
each optional part of the kernel, whether you want it bound into the
kernel (a "Y" response), created as an LKM (an "M" response), or just
skipped completely (an "N" response).  Other configuration methods are
similar.</P
><P
>As explained in <A
HREF="#THECASE"
>Section 2.3</A
>, you should have
only the bare minimum bound into the base kernel.  And only skip

><P
>So you've successfully loaded an LKM, and verified that via
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/modules</TT
>.  But how do you know it's working?
That's up to the LKM, and varies according to what kind of LKM it is,
but here are some of the more common actions of an LKM upon being loaded.</P
><P
>The first thing a device driver LKM does after loading (which is what
the module would do at boot time if it were bound into the base
kernel) is usually to search the system for a device it knows how to
drive.  Just how it does this search varies from one driver to the 
next, and can usually be controlled by module parameters.  But in any
case, if the driver doesn't find any device it is capable of driving,
it causes the load to fail.  Otherwise, the driver registers itself
as the driver for a particular major number and you can start using
the device it found via a device special file that specifies that
major number.  It may also register itself as the handler for the
interrupt level that the device uses.  It may also send setup commands
to the device, so you may see lights blink or something like that.</P
><P
>You can see that a device driver has registered itself in the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/devices</TT
>.  You can see that the device
driver is handling the device's interrupts in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/interrupts</TT
>.</P
><P
>A nice device driver issues kernel messages telling what devices it
found and is prepared to drive.  (Kernel messages in most systems end
up on the console and in the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/log/messages</TT
>.  You can also display recent
ones with the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dmesg</B
> program).  Some drivers, however, are
silent.  A nice device driver also gives you (in kernel messages) some
details of its search when it fails to find a device, but many just
fail the load without explanation, and what you get is a list of
guesses from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> as to what the problem might
have been.</P
><P
>A network device (interface) driver works similarly, except that the
LKM registers a device name of its choosing
(e.g. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eth0</TT
>) rather than a major number.  You can
see the currently registered network device names in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/net/dev</TT
></P
><P
>A filesystem driver, upon loading, registers itself as the driver for
a filesystem type of a certain name.  For example, the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>msdos</TT
> driver registers itself as the driver for the
filesystem type named <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>msdos</TT
>.  (LKM authors typically
name the LKM the same as the filesystem type it will drive).</P

><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"

out which LKMs prerequire (refer to symbols in) other LKMs.  It
generates a dependency file (typically named

This is an LKM that is in "deleted" state.  It's something of a
misnomer -- what it means is that the LKM is in the process of being 
unloaded.  You can no longer load LKMs that depend on it, but it's still
present in the system.  Unloading an LKM is usually close to instantaneous,
so if you see this status, you probably have a broken LKM.  Its cleanup
routine probably got into an infinite loop or stall or crashed (causing a
kernel oops).  If that's the case, the only way to clear this status is to
reboot.</P

problem with having the kernel in multiple files, possibly distributed
independently of one another.  What if the LKM

the Linux 1.2.1 base kernel, and then someone tried to load it into a
Linux 1.2.2 kernel?  What if there was a change between 1.2.1 and
1.2.2 in the way a kernel subroutine that
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

kernel subroutines, so what's to stop them from changing from one
release to the next?  You could end up with a broken kernel.</P

kernel version number.  The special <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

>
section of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>mydriver.o</TT

"1.2.1" in it because it was compiled using header files from Linux
1.2.1.  Try to load it into a 1.2.2 kernel and
<B

they don't change with every minor release.  Must we recompile every

I recommend you always use <TT

></TT
>.  You will, however,
still get a warning message about the mismatch.  There's no way to
shut that off.</P
><P
>But LKM designers still wanted to address the problem of incompatible
changes that do occasionally happen.  So they invented a very clever
way to allow the LKM insertion process to be sensitive to the actual
content of each kernel subroutine the LKM uses.  It's called symbol
versioning (or sometimes less clearly, "module versioning.").  It's
optional, and you select it when you configure the kernel via the
"CONFIG_MODVERSIONS" kernel configuration option.  </P
><P
>When you build a base kernel or LKM with symbol versioning, the
various symbols exported for use by LKMs get defined as macros.  The
definition of the macro is the same symbol name plus a hexadecimal
hash value of the parameter and return value types for the subroutine
named by the symbol (based on an analysis by the program
<B

Bob's LKM provides the service bobsService() and declares it to be
a GPL symbol.  The LKM consequently exports bobsService() under the
name GPLONLY_bobsService.  If Mary's LKM refers to bobsService, the
naive loader will not be able to find it, so will fail to load Mary's
LKM.</P

><P
>"Initrd" is the name of the "initial ramdisk" feature of Linux.  With
this, you have your loader (probably LILO or Grub) load a filesystem into
memory (as a ramdisk) before starting the kernel.  When it starts the
kernel, it tells it to mount the ramdisk as the root filesystem.  You
put the disk device driver for your real root filesystem and all the
software you need to load it in that ramdisk filesystem.  Your startup
programs (which live in the ramdisk) eventually mount the real (disk)
filesystem as the root filesystem.  Note that a ramdisk doesn't
require any device driver.</P

are not meant to be referenced by anything except a debugger.  Kdb,
the kernel debugger that comes with the Linux kernel, is one user of
kallsyms symbols.</P
><P
>The kallsyms facility works for both the base kernel and LKMs.  For the
base kernel, you select it when you build the base kernel, with the 
CONFIG_KALLSYMS configuration option.  When you do that, the kernel
contains a kallsyms symbol for all the symbols in the base kernel
object files.  You know your base kernel is participating in the kallsyms
facility if you see the symbol <TT

><P
>Each loaded LKM that is participating in kallsyms has its own kallsyms
symbol table.  When the base kernel is participating in the kallsyms
facility, the individual LKM kallysms symbol tables are linked into a
master symbol table so that a debugger can look up a symbol anywhere
in the kernel.  When the base kernel is not participating in kallsyms,
a debugger must look explicitly at a particular LKM to find symbols
for that LKM.  Kdb, for one, cannot do this.  So the basic rule is: If
you're going to do any kernel debugging, use CONFIG_KALLSYMS.</P
><P
>Note that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

with LKMs.  That's a section in the base kernel object module.  The
base kernel doesn't have the luxury of something as high-level as
sophisticated as <B

that extra object file section to facilitate its participation in
kallsyms.</P

These are unrelated to the kallsyms facility.  They do not get loaded

>By the time you load an LKM, real memory is all fragmented -- you
can't simply add the LKM to the end of the base kernel.  But the LKM
needs to be in contiguous virtual memory, so Linux uses
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>vmalloc</TT
> to allocate a contiguous area of virtual
memory (in the kernel address space), which is probably not contiguous
in real memory.  But <EM
>the memory is still not
pageable</EM
>.  The LKM gets loaded into real page frames from
the start, and stays in those real page frames until it gets unloaded.</P
><P
>This design is based on the principle that it's much easier to get a
large contiguous area of virtual memory than to get a large contiguous
area of real memory because there is orders of magnitude more virtual
address space than real memory.  In the early days of virtual memory,
that was certainly true -- a 32 bit machine had a 4GiB virtual address
space and rarely more than 64 MiB of real memory.  Now, however, it's
quite often just the reverse, with virtual address space being the
constrained resource.  So this LKM loading strategy may not make sense
on your system.</P
><P
>Some CPUs can take advantage of the properties of the base kernel to 
effect faster access to base kernel memory.  For example, on one 
machine, the entire base kernel is covered by one page table entry
and consequently one entry in the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).
Naturally, that TLB entry is virtually always present.  For LKMs on
this machine, there is a page table entry for each memory page into
which the LKM is loaded.  Much more often, the entry for a page is not
in the TLB when the CPU goes to access it, which means a slower access.</P
><P
>This effect is probably trivial.</P
><P
>It is also said that PowerPC Linux does something with its address
translation so that transferring between accessing base kernel memory
to accessing LKM memory is costly.  I don't know anything solid about
that.</P
><P
>The base kernel contains within its prized contiguous domain a large
expanse of reusable memory -- the kmalloc pool.  In some versions of
Linux, the module loader tries first to get contiguous memory from
that pool into which to load an LKM and only if a large enough space
was not available, go to the vmalloc space.  Andi Kleen submitted code
to do that in Linux 2.5 in October 2002.  He claims the difference is
in the several per cent range.</P

>11.4. Module Use Counts</H2
><P
>It is essential that the kernel not try to reference the code of a
module after it has been unloaded; i.e. you must not unload a module
while it is in use.  An example of in use is a device driver for which
a device special file is open.  Because there is an open file
descriptor for it, a user might do a read of the device and to execute
that read, the kernel would want to call a function that is in the
device driver.  You can see that there would be a problem if you
unloaded that device driver module before the read -- the kernel would
reuse the memory that used to contain the read subroutine and there's
no telling what instructions the kernel would branch to when it thinks
it's calling the read subroutine.</P
><P
>In the original design, the LKM increments and decrements its use
count to tell the module manager whether it is OK to unload it.  For
example, if it's a filesystem driver, it would increment the use count
when someone mounts a filesystem of the type it drives, and decrement
it at unmount time.</P
><P
>Later a more flexible alternative was added.  Your LKM can register a
function that the module manager will call whenever it wants to know
if it is OK to unload the module.  If the function returns a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>true</TT
> value, that means the LKM is busy and cannot
be unloaded.  If it returns a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>false</TT
> value, the LKM
is idle and can be unloaded.  The module manager holds the big kernel
lock from before calling the module-busy function until after its
cleanup subroutine returns or sleeps, and unless you've done something
odd, that should mean that your LKM cannot become busy between the
time that you report "not busy" and the time you clean up.</P
><P
>So how do you register the module-busy function?  By putting its
address in the unfortunately named <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>can_unload</TT
> field
in the module descriptor ("struct module").  The name is truly
unfortunate because the boolean value it returns is the exact opposite
of what "can unload" means: true if the module manager
<EM
>cannot</EM
> unload the LKM.</P
><P
>The module manager ensures that it does not attempt to unload the
module before its initialization subroutine has returned or sleeps, so
you are safe in setting the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>can_unload</TT
> field
anywhere in the initialization subroutine except after a sleep.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>can_unload</TT
> is little known and rarely used.  Starting
with Linux 2.6, it no longer exists.</P
><P
>Whether you use traditional use counts of
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>can_unload</TT
>, there are cases where you cannot be
sure that your module doesn't get unloaded while it is still in use.
If your LKM creates a kernel thread that executes LKM code, it is just
about impossible to be absolutely sure that thread is gone before the
LKM gets unloaded.  There are various other kernel services that you
can give addresses within your LKM that won't properly let you know
when they have forgotten them.</P
><P
>The problem used to be worse than it is now.  For example, it used to
be that if your LKM created a proc filesystem file, you couldn't stop
the LKM from getting unloaded while some process was executing your
read and write routines for the file.  This and other instances of the
problem have been fixed by having code <EM
>outside</EM
>
the LKM understand that the address it's using might be in an LKM, and
therefore increment and decrement the use count as necessary.  Where
this function is implemented, you often see a structure member named
"owner" which is a handle for the LKM (i.e. a struct module address).</P
><P
>These problems may be fixed in future version of Linux.  Until then,
you can just cross your fingers.  Some people believe these types of
problems are so hard to fix that the proper design for Linux is just
to make it impossible ever to unload an LKM.  Starting with Linux 2.6,
the CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD kernel build configuration option determines
whether module unloading is allowed or not.</P

><P
>One thing that deserves mention in this section is the variety of
Linux versions that exist in the world and what we call them.  Unlike
a proprietary software product where one company carefully controls
the name and creates a small number of well defined releases,
variations of Linux are developed by lots of different independent
people and all of them are called Linux.</P
><P
>The most basic Linux releases are controlled by Linus Torvalds and
distributed by kernel.org as the main Linux releases.  They are the
only releases that can properly by called "Linux 2.4," "Linux 2.6.6,"
etc.</P
><P
>But hardly anybody uses those releases.  Instead, people start with
those releases and make modifications.  People often sloppily refer to
a Linux based on Linux 2.6.6 as Linux 2.6.6 itself.  But to be
correct, you have to add something -- usually a hyphen and a suffix.
Red Hat versions of Linux, which you see a lot, unfortunately use just
a plain number for that suffix, e.g. Linux 2.6.6-12.  (It would be
better if they used something more explicitly Red Hat, such as Linux
2.6.6-rh12).</P

><P
>The biggest change to LKMs between Linux 2.4 and Linux 2.6 is an
internal one: LKMs get loaded much differently.  Most people
won't see any difference except that the suffix on a file containing
an LKM has changed, because they use high level tools to manage
the LKMs and the interface to those tools hasn't changed.</P
><P
>Before Linux 2.6, a user space program would interpret the ELF object
(.o) file and do all the work of linking it to the running kernel,
generating a finished binary image.  The program would pass that image
to the kernel and the kernel would do little more than stick it in
memory.  In Linux 2.6, the kernel does the linking.  A user space
program passes the contents of the ELF object file directly to the
kernel.  For this to work, the ELF object image must contain
additional information.  To identify this particular kind of ELF
object file, we name the file with suffix ".ko"
("kernel object") instead of ".o"  For example,
the serial device driver that in Linux 2.4 lived in the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>serial.o</TT
> in Linux 2.6 lives in the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>serial.ko</TT
>.</P
><P
>So there is a whole new <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

> package
for use with Linux 2.6.  In it, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> is a trivial
program, as compared to the full blown linker of the Linux 2.4
version.</P
><P
>Also, the procedure to build an LKM is somewhat harder.  To make a .ko
file, you start with a regular .o file.  You run the program <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modpost</B
> (which comes with the Linux source code) on it to
create a C source file that describes the additional sections the .ko
file needs.  We'll call this the .mod file because you conventionally
include ".mod" in the file name.</P
><P
>You compile the .mod file and link the result with the original .o
file to make a .ko file.</P
><P
>The .mod object file contains the name that the LKM instance will have
when you load the LKM.  You set that name with a -D compile option
(when you compile the .mod file) that sets the KBUILD_MODNAME macro.</P
><P
>This change means some things are decidedly harder -- choosing the name for
the LKM instance, for example.  In Linux 2.4, the name was one of the
inputs to the kernel.  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> decided on the name
and passed it to the kernel.  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B

told it explicitly what to use for the LKM instance name.  But in 2.6,
there is no such parameter on the system call and hence no -o option
on <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
>.  The name is part of the ELF object (.o
file) that you pass to the kernel.  The default name is built into the
ELF object, but if you want to load it with some other name, you must
edit the ELF image before passing it to <B

>13. Copyright Considerations With LKMs</H1
><P
>A perennial question about LKMs is whether the terms of GPL apply to
one, considering that the Linux kernel is distributed under GPL.  For
example, is it OK to ship an LKM in binary only form?  This section
covers the copyright issues surrounding LKMs, which are as interesting
as they are complex.  Fair warning: we don't reach a conclusion.  The
law is unsettled and there are plenty of good but conflicting
arguments.</P
><P
>Remember that countries have varying copyright laws, so even if you
figure out the answer to a question in one country, it might be
different in another.  But copyright laws are actually remarkably
similar, and this section won't go into the matter in enough detail
that it will really make a difference.</P
><P
>Let's start at the beginning and look at what a copyright is.</P
><P
>Primarily, a copyright is a person's right to stop other people from
copying something.  It is a legal right, not a moral one.  That means
it is created by law to bring about some practical effect, rather than
something that people believe people are naturally entitled to.</P
><P
>The primary effect that copyright seeks to bring about is that an author gets
paid for what he created.  Some people believe that is a valid goal
itself, because an author has a natural right to the value that he
creates.  But historically, that isn't the real goal of copyright.
The real goal is secondary to making the author get paid for his work:
It causes the author to create in the first place.  An author is more
likely to spend time and money writing if he will get paid for it.</P
><P
>The actual operation of copyright law achieves that goal only
approximately.  We've all seen cases where the law is used to transfer
wealth in ways that don't contribute to that goal at all.  For
example, a music publisher denies a person permission to copy a song
that he wouldn't have paid for anyway.  Legislators think of that as
collateral damage -- what copyright law does to cause things to get
written makes up for the senseless copy restrictions in other cases.</P
><P
>But when it comes to LKMs, there is another, much more complex area of
copyright law that matters: derivative works.  Copyright law gives an
author the right to stop someone from creating a derivative work.  A
derivative work is <EM
>not</EM
> a copy of anything the
author wrote.  So what is it?</P
><P
>The definition of derivative work is elusive, but here are some
examples: When you translate a book from English into French, the
French version is a derivative work of the English work.  If you write
a new chapter for a novel, your new chapter is a derivative work of
the novel.  If you write a whole new book for the Harry Potter series,
with the same characters and settings, that is a derivative work of
all the Harry Potter books.  If you draw a Dilbert cartoon you thought
of on a birthday card, that is a derivative work of all the Dilbert
strips, books, etc.</P
><P
>And this brings us to LKMs, because many people believe that an LKM is
a derivative work of the Linux kernel.  The Free Software Foundation
has said so.  Linus Torvalds has said it is sometimes.  No court of
law has ever ruled one way or the other.</P
><P
>Now let's turn to the copyright on Linux.  For the sake of discussion,
when we say "Linux," we will mean the contents of the
tarball you download from kernel.org as the regular Linux kernel.</P
><P
>Who owns the copyright on Linux?  Lots of people.  Nearly everyone who
has contributed code to Linux reserved his own copyright.  Some of
that work was done for hire and therefore the employing corporations
own the copyright.  Linus Torvalds is the most visible copyright
owner, but he holds copyright on a very small part of Linux.</P
><P
>How do these people prosecute their copyright?  Well, nobody makes
deals with them to purchase copying rights.  It wouldn't be practical.
However, they all offer a copyright license -- the same one -- to the
public.  The license is documented and offered in a file in the
tarball, and is known as the General Public License (GPL).  GPL is not
specific to Linux.  It was developed by the Free Software Foundation
before Linux existed, and was simply chosen by Linus back when he was
the only copyright owner.  And Linus doesn't put any code into the
tarball without the author offering the same license.</P
><P
>A copyright license is permission by a copyright owner to do something
that he has a legal right to stop you from doing, such as make a copy
or a derivative work.  What it means to be a public license is that it
is offered to the public, as opposed to the copyright owner offering
it to particular persons he knows about.</P
><P
>The GPL lets you do almost anything with the code -- it's almost like
the copyright owners waiving all their copyright rights.  But not
quite: there are strings attached.  The license has conditions.  In
order to have the permission, you have to meet the conditions.  The
condition we care about here is one of two things, or both, depending
on how you read the license document (the document is ambiguous).
Either a) if you distribute a derivative work of Linux, you
have to supply source code for the whole derivative work; or b) if you
distribute a work containing Linux, you have to supply source code for
the entire work.</P
><P
>Now we come to the real question: what sort of rights do you have to
distribute an LKM you wrote?</P
><P
>Certainly, many people believe that you can distribute an LKM under
any terms you like, including binary-only and the owners of the Linux
copyright have nothing to say about it.  You're distributing nothing
but your own code.  And it's not a derivative work of anything.  Many
people do distribute binary-only LKMs and believe that a principle
benefit of LKMs is the ability to do that.</P
><P
>Others think differently: The LKM, while an original work, is a
derivative work of Linux.  The Linux copyright owners have the right
to control distribution.  The only permission they gave you to
distribute it is GPL, and that permission is only under the condition
that you supply source code.</P

>Let's look a little closer at the issue of whether an LKM is a
derivative work of Linux.  The argument in favor goes that writing an
LKM is like writing a supplemental chapter for a novel.  We know the
latter is creating a derivative work.  The LKM is like the chapter
because it's specifically designed to be part of a whole with the
existing Linux kernel.  It has no use in any other context, and when
deployed, is tightly woven into the rest of Linux.  The fact that you
typically use a bunch of Linux header files to compile it is proof
that it's just an extension of Linux (don't confuse this with another
argument -- that the #include actually means you're distributing that
header file inside your object code).  And note that a kernel module
loaded at run time is essentially the same program you would
statically bind into the base kernel if you chose to go that route.
If writing a module for the Linux source tree is creating a derivative
work, then so must be writing an LKM.  LKMs often have to be updated
to conform to updates the base kernel.</P

>Wasabi Systems, a company that sells kernels with freer licensing than
Linux, has published <A
HREF="http://www.wasabisystems.com/gpl/lkm.html"
TARGET="_top"
>a paper</A
> that
argues in more detail that LKMs are derivative works of Linux and you
should therefore be wary of publishing binary-only LKMs for it.</P
><P
>The argument against says that an LKM is something that interacts with
Linux, not something that is part of Linux.  It likens the LKM to a
user space program, communicating with the kernel via system calls,
or an FTP client program (which would not be a derivative work of any
FTP server program).</P
><P
>The issue also runs into one of those areas where books and computer
programs aren't analogous because a computer program does something,
whereas a book just communicates an idea to a person.  Loading an LKM
might be more like plugging an attachment into your vacuum cleaner
than like inserting pages into your book.  And we know that the
blueprints for a vacuum cleaner attachment are not a derivative work
of the blueprints for a vacuum cleaner.</P
><P
>So that's as far as I can go.  There appears to be a matter of degree
here and a judge will have to draw a line somewhere.</P
><P
>But if you need to make a practical decision, consider that there have
been well-known binary LKMs (drivers for Nvidia video adapters seem
to be the most famous) for years and no one has sued for copyright
infringement.  Also, Linus Torvalds, influential for reasons other than
legal, has said binary-only LKMs are OK with him.</P
><P
>What about GPL-ONLY symbols?  Kernel developers have selected some
symbols that one uses in interfacing an LKM to the base kernel as
GPL-only.  These symbols have "GPL_ONLY" in their names,
making this intent obvious.  Furthermore, in order for the Linux
module loader to let your LKM use them, you must include some code in
your LKM that supposedly certifies you license your module under GPL.</P
><P
>These probably have no legal significance.  If the LKM is not a
derivative work of Linux, then the kernel developers simply have no
legal way to block you from putting the GPL annotation in your code
and distributing it binary-only anyhow.  If the LKM
<EM
>is</EM
> a derivative work of Linux, then the absence
of the GPL-only classification of the symbol is probably not enough to
give permission to use it in a binary-only LKM.  The license document
does not mention them.  At best, you can use GPL-only symbols as a
gentleman's promise not to sue you for use of all the other symbols in
a binary-only LKM.</P

>15.1.3. binfmt_java: executable interpreter for Java bytecode</H3
><P
>Java is a relatively modern object oriented programming language.
Java programs are traditionally compiled into "Java bytecode" which is
meant to be interpreted by a Java bytecode interpreter.  The point of
this new object language is that the bytecode object files are
portable: Although different systems require different object formats,
as long as each system has a bytecode interpreter, it can run bytecode
object files.  (This only works for a while, of course.  If
portability were that easy, all systems today would use the same
object format anyway).</P
><P
>While the intent was that the bytecode interpreter would run as a user
space program, with this LKM you can make the Linux kernel interpret
Java bytecode like any other executable format.  So you can run a
program compiled from Java the same as you would run a program
compiled from C (e.g. type its name at a command shell prompt).</P
><P
>In practice, the advantages of the intermediate bytecode language have
not been proven and it is quite common to compile Java directly to a
more traditional executable format, such as ELF.  If you do that, you
don't need <B

           This is needed on HP Omnibooks, which don't have a workable
           DMA channel for the floppy driver.  This option is also
           useful if you frequently get "Unable to allocate DMA
           memory" messages.  Indeed, DMA memory needs to be
           continuous in physical memory, and is thus harder to find,
           whereas non-DMA buffers may be allocated in virtual
           memory. However, I advise against this if you have an FDC
           without a FIFO (8272A or 82072). 82072A and later are
           OK).  You also need at least a 486 to use nodma.  If you use
           nodma mode, I suggest you also set the FIFO threshold to 10
           or lower, in order to limit the number of data transfer
           interrupts.
        </P
><P
>           If you have a FIFO-able FDC, the floppy driver
           automatically falls back on non DMA mode if it can't find
           any DMA-able memory.  If you want to avoid this, explicitly
           specify "yesdma".

identify transfer function (which is for the normal no-encoding case
-- What you see in the loop device is exactly what is in the backing
file) and a simple XOR encryption function.  A separate kernel module
can add any transfer function by calling the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>loop</TT
>
module's exported <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>loop_register_transfer()</TT
> function.</P
><P
>There appear to be various modules floating around 
that provide transfer functions to do compression and encryption (DES,
IDEA, Fish, etc.).
Some of them appear to be part of current Linux kernel distributions.
In addition, there appear to be various alternative loop device drivers,
many of them also called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

>, that have such transfer 
functions built in.</P
><P
>Do not confuse these loop devices with the "loopback device"
used for network connections from the machine to itself.  That isn't
actually a device at all - it's a network interface.</P
><P
>This module is a block device driver.  You set up a loop device by
issuing an ioctl to it to bind a file to it.  The typical program to
issue this ioctl is <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>losetup</B
>.  See the documentation
of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>losetup</B
> for more details.  There are also options
on the normal 'mount' command to do loop device setup under the covers,
but because that confuses the logically separate operations of setting
up a loop device and mounting a filesystem, for the sake of clarity
you're probably better off using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

><P
>A ramdisk is a block device whose storage is composed of system memory
(real memory; not virtual).  You can use it like a very fast disk
device and also in circumstances where you need a device, but don't
have traditional hardware devices to play with.</P
><P
>A common example of the latter is for a rescue system -- a system
you use to diagnose and repair your real system.  Since you don't
want to mess with your real disks, you run off ramdisks.  You might
load data into these ramdisks from external media such as floppy 
disks.</P
><P
>Sometimes, you have your boot loader (e.g. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lilo</B
>)
create a ramdisk and load it with data (perhaps from a floppy disk).
Of course, if you do this, you cannot use the LKM version of the
ramdisk driver because the driver will have to be in the kernel at
boot time.</P
><P
>A ramdisk is actually conceptually simple in Linux.  Disk devices
operate through memory because of the buffer cache.  The only
difference with a ramdisk is that you never actually get past the
buffer cache to a real device.  This is because with a ramdisk, 1)
when you first access a particular block, Linux just assumes it is
all zeroes; and 2) the device's buffer cache blocks are never
written to the device, ergo never stolen for use with other devices.
This means reads and writes are always to the buffer cache and never
reach the device.</P
><P
>There is additional information about ramdisks in the file
<TT

>15.3. SCSI Drivers</H2
><P
>Detailed information about SCSI drivers is in 
<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>SCSI-2.4-HOWTO</I
>.</P
><P
>Linux's SCSI function is implemented in three layers, and there are
LKMs for all of them.</P
><P
>In the middle is the mid-level driver or SCSI core.  This consists of
the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>scsi_mod</B
> LKM.  It does all those things that
are common among SCSI devices regardless of what SCSI adapter you use
and what class of device (disk, scanner, CD-ROM drive, etc.) it is.</P
><P
>There is a low-level driver for each kind of SCSI adapter --
typically, a different driver for each brand.  For example, the
low-level driver for Advansys adapters (made by the company which is
now Connect.com) is named <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>advansys</B
>.  (If you are
comparing ATA (aka IDE) and SCSI disk devices, this is a major
difference -- ATA is simple and standard enough that one driver works
with all adapters from all companies.  SCSI is less standard and as a
result you should have less confidence in any particular adapter being
perfectly compatible with your system).</P
><P
>High-level drivers present to the rest of the kernel an interface
appropriate to a certain class of devices.  The SCSI high-level driver
for tape devices, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>st</B
>, for example, has ioctls to
rewind.  The high-level SCSI driver for CD-ROM drives,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sr</B
>, does not.</P
><P
>Note that you rarely need a high-level driver specific to a certain 
brand of device.  At this level, there is little room for one brand to
be distinguishable from another.</P
><P
>One SCSI high-level driver that deserves special mention is
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sg</B
>.  This driver, called the "SCSI generic" driver,
is a fairly thin layer that presents a rather raw representation of
the SCSI mid-level driver to the rest of the kernel.  User space
programs that operate through the SCSI generic driver (because they
access device special files whose major number is the one registered
by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sg</B
> (to wit, 21)) have a detailed understanding
of SCSI protocols, whereas user space programs that operate through
other SCSI high-level drivers typically don't even know what SCSI is.
<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>SCSI-Programming-HOWTO</I
> has complete
documentation of the SCSI generic driver.</P
><P
>The layering order of the SCSI modules belies the way the LKMs depend
upon each other and the order in which they must be loaded.  You
always load the mid-level driver first and unload it last.  The
low-level and high-level drivers can be loaded and unloaded in any
order after that, and they hook themselves into and establish
dependency on the mid-level driver at both ends.  If you don't have a
complete set, you will get a "device not found" error when you try to
access a device.</P
><P
>Most SCSI low-level (adapter) drivers don't have LKM parameters; they
do generally autoprobe for card settings.  If your card responds to
some unconventional port address you must bind the driver into the
base kernel and use kernel "command line" options.  See
<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>BootPrompt-HOWTO</I
>.  Or you can twiddle The
Source and recompile.</P
><P
>Many SCSI low-level drivers have documentation in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>drivers/scsi</TT
> directory in the Linux
source tree, in files called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README.</TT

a time or using special PLIP cables, to be used on bidirectional
parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a time.  The cables
can be up to 15 meters long.  This works also if one of the machines
runs DOS/Windows and has some PLIP software installed, e.g.  the

><P
>STRIP is a radio protocol developed for the <A
HREF="http://mosquitonet.stanford.edu/"
TARGET="_top"
>MosquitoNet project</A
> to
send Internet traffic using Metricom radios.  Metricom radios are
small, battery powered, 100kbit/sec packet radio transceivers, about
the size and weight of a wireless telephone.  (You may also have heard
them called "Metricom modems" but we avoid the term "modem" because it
misleads many people into thinking that you can plug a Metricom modem
into a phone line and use it as a modem.)  You can use STRIP on any
Linux machine with a serial port, although it is obviously most useful
for people with laptop computers.</P

>You probably know this type of disk as
"IDE".  Strictly speaking, IDE is an incorrect appelation.
IDE refers to the "Integrated Drive Electronics" technology which all
modern disk drives, notably including all SCSI disk drives, use.  The first IDE
drives in common usage were ATA, and the names kind of got confused.
ATA, like SCSI, is a precise specification of electrical signals,
commands, etc.  </P
