>This HOWTO is intended for anyone interested in installing and
    using IBM DB2® Express-C 9 on a Linux® distribution. The goal is
    to include as many distributions as possible, on both 32&#8211;bit and
    64&#8211;bit architectures, however both hardware and time resources are
    constrained, so if you come across a distribution/architecture combination
    that isn't covered in here or if you encounter a problem that isn't
    addressed, send a note to db2howto@gmail.com and I'll try to help verify or
    resolve your issue and add the information here.</P

><P
>Ian Hakes, has worked for IBM DB2 since 1999. Currently,
    he is involved in technical marketing for the DB2 Express-C product,
    developing technical documentation and evangelizing DB2 Express-C.
    Before that, he was the technical team lead for the DB2 Information
    Development department, and the writer responsible for the DB2 SQL
    Reference manual. His free time is spent mainly typing on computers,
    thinking about how much nicer it would be to watch a movie or to be
    sailing.</P

>2. Why DB2 Express-C 9?</H1
><P
>In March of 2006, IBM made a strategic decision to release their best
  of breed DB2 database as freely available software. It is important to
  realize that the DB2 Express-C edition is a gratis, "free as in beer" software product,
  meaning that, although the source code is not distributed as part of the product,
  this edition of DB2 is freely useable and full featured, not "crippled" in any way.
  </P
><P
>A number of other large enterprise class databases have also opted to
  release versions of their software, but DB2 Express-C is the only one that
  places no restrictions on the size or number of the databases that can be
  created. The one restriction to using DB2 Express-C is that it can only be run
  on systems with 2 physical CPUs and 4 GB of RAM. Since the majority of
  developers and small businesses run systems within these specifications, DB2
  Express-C makes a great choice for developers and business applications.
  In this HOWTO, all testing and discussions are based on machines that fall
  within these system specifications.
  </P
><P
>With DB2 Express-C, you get a free, low maintenance database application
  that is easy to install and run, with a number of powerful features, as well
  as performance typically found in much more expensive enterprise-level
  database software.
  </P

NAME="whatsinexpc9"

>3. What's included in DB2 Express-C 9</H1
><P
>&#13;  Feature-wise, what's included in the DB2 Express-C download is impressive. To
  start with, you get the same database engine code as the full enterprise-level
  database server, with no connection restrictions. Also included is the full
  suite of commmand line and graphical user tools to help adminster databases
  and develop database applications. You also get autonomic maintenance features,
  along with development APIs and drivers for C/C++, Java, PHP, Perl and Ruby on
  Rails.
  </P
><P
>The cherry on top is the inclusion of IBM's new pureXML&#8482;
  hybrid technology that allows you to store XML data natively inside the
  database, without any shredding or decomposition of the data. This is a
  feature that is typically an add-on to the other editions of DB2 9, and IBM is
  giving it to users of the Express-C edition completely free of charge. Sometimes
  it's good to be the little guy.  
  </P
><P
>There are three architecture choices available for Linux: the 32-bit version, the
  64-bit version, and the PowerPC version, giving you the option of using the best
  hardware you have available for your DB2 installation.

      </P

>&#13;      In DB2 9, product documentation is accessed through the DB2 Information
      Center, either via the web, or as a local system installation. To install
      this locally requires at least 100 MB when installing the core English
      language files. Additional space is required for other additional languages. If
      disk space is an issue, you can configure DB2 to access the Information
      Center from the Web. More detail about this is provided in

><P
>The <B
CLASS="command"

      graphical tool that configures and organizes the DB2 installation. It lays
      down the DB2 filesets, creates and configures DB2 instances, users and
      groups, communications, the administration database used by the DB2 Tools,
      and sets up notification processes. The DB2 Launchpad also allows
      you to create a response file for replicating a particular setup to other
      systems.</P
><P
>Using <B
CLASS="command"
>db2setup</B
> is the best method for less
      experienced users, because most of the configuration is automatically
      performed during the installation. As mentioned previously, you require an

      <B

CLASS="command"

> command script installs all DB2
      packages on your Linux system. This method is reliable and commonly used
      by expert users for installing DB2 on larger, more complex systems.
      However, tasks such as setting up users and groups, creating instances,
      tools catalog database creation, and notification setup need to be
      performed manually after the installation is completed.</P
><P
>One limitation to <B

      installs user assistance (like help, messages, and tool interfaces) in
      English, whereas <B
CLASS="command"

      additional languages. Also, a <B
CLASS="command"
>db2_install</B

      installation can take longer (because of the higher number of manual
      configuration tasks); it requires a higher level of knowledge and skill,

>5.1.3. Response file installation</H3
><P
>A response file can be created using the DB2 Setup Wizard or by
      editing an existing DB2 response (.rsp) file. It allows you to install DB2
      across multiple machines with consistent installation and configuration
      settings. A response file installation is fast, because it bypasses the
      graphical wizard configuration. Another advantage of
      using a response file instead of the <B
CLASS="command"
>db2_install</B
>
      command is that it creates a Database Administration Server (DAS) on each
      machine, while with
      <B
CLASS="command"
>db2_install</B
> the DAS must be created manually after
      installation.</P
><P
>There is a sample response file (db2exp.rsp) included on the installation image
      that can be modified and used to install DB2, configure users, create
      instances, set up notification, create the tools catalog, and configure a
      large number of database management parameters. This is the quickest
      installation method if you already have all the information you need.
      Unlike
      <B
CLASS="command"
>db2setup</B
>, the response file installation is not
      interactive, and it takes longer to prepare the response file initially.</P

>
    file. If you have enabled your firewall (using the
    <B
CLASS="command"

    connectivity to your DB2 server, you must open up TCP and UDP access to
    ports 523 and TCP access to any DB2 service ports. To make this work, add
    these rules to the <TT

    These rules were added directly to the <TT

    or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for

    designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
    can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License

>23.2. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H2
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any
    medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
    can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
    grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
    that work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
    refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
    licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
    under copyright law.</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
    the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
    a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
    allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
    Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
    Sections then there are none.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
    says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
    Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
    words.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
    copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
    is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
    that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
    transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
    include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
    proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
    HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
    purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
    which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
    near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
    beginning of the body of the text.</P
><P
>A section "Entitled XYZ"
    means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely
    XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in
    another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
    below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or
    "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify
    the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to
    this definition.</P
><P
>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
    which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.</P

>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
    the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
    of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
    3.</P

>23.4. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H2
><P
>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
    have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
    Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
    cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
    to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
    satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
    Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
    Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
    network-using public has access to download using public-standard
    network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
    added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
    prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
    to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
    stated location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)

    under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
    release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
    Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
    distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
    possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
    Modified Version:

          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
          section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
          version if the original publisher of that version gives
          permission.</P

    Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be
    distinct from any other section titles.</P

    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
    Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
    and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by)
    any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same
    cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you
    are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the
    old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the
    old one.</P

    of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
    Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
    all their Warranty Disclaimers.</P

>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If
    there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
    contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of
    it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that
    section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the
    section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</P

>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
    likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections
    Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled

    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</P

>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
    from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
    compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
    Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
    other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of
    the Document.</P
><P
>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
    entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on
    printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</P

>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
    from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
    all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
    Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all
    the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
    that you also include the original English version of this License and the
    original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
    disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
    License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</P
><P
>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
    Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</P

    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
