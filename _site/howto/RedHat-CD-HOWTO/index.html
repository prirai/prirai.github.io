>      This document describes how to make your own CDs from different releases of 
      the Red Hat Linux distribution (up to and including release 9), equivalent 
      to the ones commercially available from Red Hat.
      The structure of the distribution is described, as well as the procedure
      needed to include updated RPMS into the distribution. Some hints and 
      examples on how to customize the default installation are also presented. 
      Scripts to automate as much as possible the (re)generation of the CD images 
      are included. Prerequisites are a good network connection, and a CD-writer 
      (a working knowledge of shell scripting could be really useful, though).

>    There may be several reasons for making your own CDs. Perhaps you're a
    cheapskate and want to save the cost of the 
    <A
HREF="http://www.redhat.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>Red Hat distribution</A
>. Or, perhaps 
    you want to include in your CDs the latest distribution with all the current
    updates. This is highly relevant, because after each major release of the
    Red Hat distribution, there have been loads of updates, several of which
    are security related. Just take a look at the
    <A
HREF="http://www.redhat.com/corp/support/errata"
TARGET="_top"
>errata page</A
>. 
    Or maybe you want to customize the default installation adding a few 
    packages not present in the default tree and unselecting the installation 
    of some packages which are otherwise included in the default setup. 
  </P
><P
>    This is what you will be taught in the next sections (hopefully). I will use the 
    i386 architecture and releases 7.3, 8.0 and 9 of the distribution in the examples. The 
    notes related to the previous releases (&#60;=6.1) were contained in a previous version of 
    this document and were compiled by the original authors. The notes related to release 
    6.2 are based on tests I've not completed (and I don't know if I ever will) and some 
    documents you can find linked in the <A
HREF="#RELATED-DOC"
>Related documentation</A
> section. 
    The procedure given in the following sections for RedHat 7.3 and 8.0 is likely to work 
    on all platforms supported by Red Hat (Alpha, ppc, etc.), for all the 7.x (and maybe 8.x/9 
    in a not too far future) releases, but I have only tested it on the i386 platform with 
    Redhat Linux 7.3, 8.0 and 9 (I would be interested in additional information).

    their Linux distributions for several platforms on their FTP site. These
    are all available from the top distribution directory 
    (<A

CLASS="FILENAME"

      part of the Red Hat distribution consisting of a set of RPM (Redhat Package 
      Manager) files. An RPM package typically contains binary executables, along 
      with relevant configuration files and documentation. See the section

      (groups of packages) used during the "Choose packages to install" phase.

>hdlist2</TT

      containing most of the header fields from all the RPMs in the 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

> directory. This means that all 
      the interdependencies among RPM packages can be determined just by reading 
      these  files without having to read all the RPM packages which is quite 
      convenient especially during FTP installs. Another use of these files is 
      mapping package names to file names (eg. <EM
>perl</EM
> to 
      <EM
>perl-5.004-6.i386.rpm</EM

      to incorporate updates from RedHat (see section <A
HREF="#INCLUDE-UPDATES"
>Including the updates</A
>) 
      or add your own packages to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

      directory, you need to update <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hdlist</TT

>3. RPM packages</H1
><P
>    The major part of the Red Hat distribution consists of a set of RPM (Redhat
    Package Manager) files.  An RPM package typically contains binary
    executables, along with relevant configuration files and documentation.
    The <A
HREF="http://www.rpm.org"
TARGET="_top"
>rpm</A
> program is a powerful
    package manager, which can be used to install, query, verify, update, erase
    and build software packages in the RPM format. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Rpm</TT
> 
    convieniently maintains a database of all the software packages it has 
    installed, so information on the installed software is available at any time.
  </P
><P
>    The binary RPM files in the distribution have been built on a system
    running the distribution itself. This is important, because most of the
    programs in the packages rely on shared libraries. From RedHat version 5.0,
    the new version 2 of the GNU standard C library (which is 64-bit clean) has
    been used. This version of the library is commonly referred to as
    <EM
>glibc</EM
> or in Linux: <EM
>libc 6</EM
>. All 
    executables in the distribution have been linked against this library. 
    If you attempt to install binary files from a different distribution, 
    chances are that they will not work, unless you install the libc5 package 
    for backwards compability. There are also incompatibilities between the 
    various version of the Redhat Package Manager itself which will make the 
    installation of some packages fail even on machines they are supposed to 
    (and they would probably) run on. 
  </P
><P
>    The names of the RPM packages contain the suffix <EM
>.arch.rpm</EM
>, 
    where <EM
>arch</EM
> is the architecture, usually having the value 
    <EM
>i386</EM
> for Intel platform binaries.  The packages you install 
    must match the versions of the shared libraries available on the machine. The 
    <A
HREF="http://www.rpm.org"
TARGET="_top"
>rpm</A
> program is usually quite good at
    ensuring that this is indeed the case, however, there are ways around this
    check, and you should be sure that you know what you are doing if you force
    installation of packages this way.  However, using the RedHat installation
    boot disk, it is ensured that the correct set of RPM packages are installed
    on the machine.
  </P

>    If you discover a RPM package that was not installed on your system during
    the installation process, don't despair. At any time, you may (as root)
    install RPM packages, for example:

CLASS="FILENAME"
>SRPMS</TT

    the last two CDs and part of the third one out of the five which compose the 8.0 (or 
    7.3) release. For release 9 they are on three separate CDs. For 6.2 (and previous, 
    not too old, versions), things change a bit because there is only one installation CD 
    not comprising the SRPMS packages, which you can burn on a different disc, if you want.

    from the computer having the CD writer (duh!). If you want to incorporate
    the latest updates, this directory should (also) be accessible from a Linux

    computer, or a JAZ disk.
    You could copy the distribution from the RedHat CDs (recommended), or you 
    could get it via FTP. If you choose to use FTP, there are two ways of doing 
    it.  You can use the <EM

        will be downloaded once more, and the updates deleted. The bash/wget based

      release 6.2, the only step composing this section was represented by 
      generating a new <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hdlist</TT
> file. With release 6.2, this 
      appears to be true only to a certain extent, because of the changes in the 
      anaconda installer, in the  <EM
>rpm</EM
> software itself 
      (from version 3.x to 4.x) and the migration of the updated packages to 
      this new version (updates for release 6.2 are in fact packaged with both 
      major releases of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rpm</TT
> software). We will consider 
      three different procedures trying to cover all the releases.

        The introduction of version 4 of the Redhat Package Manager (RPM), made the 
        procedure to update the anaconda installer fail. So the procedures listed will 
        work only if the updated packages were built using a version of the RPM 
        software which is older than or equal to 3.0.4 (so, basically, 3.0.4 or 3.0.5).
      </P
><P
>        If you are using the original packages from Redhat, you have to avoid using 
        updates released after 28 March 2001 (which is a bit useless, in my opinion) 
        or you have to rebuild the packages using the old rpm format. Details on the 
        downgrade procedure and tools which implement it can be found in the document 
        <A
HREF="http://www.tigress.co.uk/rmy/rh62/rpmhack.html"
TARGET="_top"
>rpmhack</A
>.
        I have not personally tested this procedure, even if it appears to work if you 
        read about it on the anaconda-devel and kickstart mailing lists (you can find 
        them on the <A
HREF="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo"
TARGET="_top"
>mailing 
        lists</A
> section of the Redhat website. 
      </P
><P
>        If you decide to stick to the old original packages and complete the update 
        (using the rpm 4.0.2 packages after the installation is finished) 
        there are two possible ways of doing it, depending on which kind of updates you
        want to complete the CD with. If some of the updates regard directly the 
        installation process (e.g. kernel, python, kudzu), you will have to use the 
        installer rebuilding procedure explained in the document
        <A
HREF="http://www.scyld.com/~pzb/rhcd.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Building a Red Hat Linux 6.2 
        CDROM</A
>, otherwise you can still use the old procedure (the one for 
        releases previous to and including 6.1 explained in the previous section).    
        The last two steps, which are, respectively, creating the iso image and burning 
        the actual media are described in <A
