<P>I got the mainboard for Christmas 2001, and after a little while, I understood
that the new chipset sis735 was not handled by 
<A HREF="http://www.mandrake.com">Mandrake</A> 8.0,
<A HREF="http://www.opensound.com">OSS</A> had drivers for it that worked
but I didn't really want to pay for it, so  I looked on ALSA cvs and found that
in their latest sources they had something for the sis 7012, and a bit later I found the drivers for the sensors.
<P>It has now been 3 years I started this howto and I am always glad to get comments, advices from everywhere in the world :]

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 ALSA versus the AC'97 Driver</A>
</H2>

<P>I have used both solutions successfully. However I noticed while working on a speech synthesis system (I was involved in a small accessibility project), that the kernel driver does not seem to be able to re-sample, whereas Alsa does it perfectly.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Alsa</A>
</H2>

<H3>Getting the ALSA drivers</H3>

<P>So we will be compiling the latest sources from ALSA, which should work for all other distributions as well... only the kernel sources will change because mandrake uses specific patches.
<P>You may get your kernel sources from your distribution or from 
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/">http://www.kernel.org</A><P>Here can be found Mandrake sources for the kernel used in 8.0:
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.univ-savoie.fr/pub/Linux/Mandrake/8.0/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/kernel- source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm">ftp://ftp.univ-savoie.fr/pub/Linux/Mandrake/8.0/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/kernel -source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm</A><P>(link seems to be broken, I wish I had made a copy if someone needed but here is the problem with that distribution, mirrors are not kept long enough)
<P>and grab the tarball from ALSA:
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2">ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2</A><P>
<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>Install your kernel sources, in my case:
<P><EM>rpm -ivh kernel-source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm</EM>
<P>Then decompress alsa drivers:
<P><EM>bzip2 -d alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2 &amp;&amp; tar -xvf
alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar</EM>
<P>Make them and install them and create the devices files:
<P><EM>cd alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10 &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; ./snddevices</EM>
<P>Edit <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> to set everything, and add to it the following
lines:

warning: Christian Cardinale rf.libertysurf@elanidrac.naitsirhc reports that he had to change 'snd-card-intel8x0' for 'snd-intel8x0', which corresponds to what I have for my Debian system, I no longer remember, but I think this one is the mandrake name, if it doesn't work, just use to the other, ok?
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Alsa the Debian way</A>
</H2>

<P>I've switched to Debian some time after writing this howto and wanted to give some instructions about it:
Things may change a little depending on which version you're using, I use Debian sarge, currently the testing version.
<P>
<H3>Using a Debian package with a precompiled kernel</H3>

<P>First of all, you can directly download the appropriate precompiled alsa modules:
find out which kernel you're using
<P><EM>uname -r</EM>
<P>2.4.20-3-k7  (should be 2.4.18-k7 or something like that for a woody/stable)
<P><EM>apt-get install alsa-modules-2.4.20-3-k7</EM>
<P>the card is the "intel8x0 (PCI: Intel i810/i820/i830/i840/MX440 integrated audio)"
<P>you should also install the recommended package alsa-utils
<P><EM>apt-get install alsa-utils</EM>
<P>now, check the file /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9 against the one given further on this howto.
It may also be necessary to run update-modules as root to ensure that these lines get into /etc/modules.conf, although the package installation probably does it itself.
<P>
<H3>Using a Debian kernel source package</H3>

<P>I was forced to recompile my kernel when I got an usb adsl modem. (make-kpkg binary --initrd is something you want to look at someday, but it's off topic)
<P>I'm assuming, you've done at least the following steps:
<P>install the alsa sources and two useful packages:
<EM>apt-get install alsa-source alsa-utils alsa-base</EM>
debconf will ask you the following questions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Say Yes if you want to build ALSA driver with ISA PnP version.
If your computer doesn't support ISA PnP, you may say No. 
Build ALSA driver with ISA PnP?

<P>You can safely select 'no'
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Say Yes if you want to build ALSA driver with debugging code.

<P>We don't need that either, so select 'no'

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

You can choose cards to be built by selecting cards you want.
Each selection is a same name to a option of configure script '--with-cards'.
The following list are short descriptions of the options to show what they mean.
Select cards to be built.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Select card intel8x0 (PCI: Intel i810/i820/i830/i840/MX440 integrated audio)
and exit.

<P><EM>cd modules/alsa-driver</EM>
<P><EM>./configure</EM>
<P><EM>make &amp;&amp; make install</EM>
<P>now, check the file /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9 against this following one.
<P>
<H3>/etc/alsa/modutils/0.9</H3>

<P>I only remember changing the cards_limit from 4 to 1, to prevent warnings,
any modification of it should be followed by running update-modules in order to regenerate /etc/modules.conf

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Kernel Approach: The AC'97 Driver</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are using a 2.4 or later kernel you can use the 
<A HREF="http://developer.intel.com/ial/scalableplatforms/audio/">Audio Codec  '97 (AC'97)</A> sound driver, as the integrated sound card is AC'97 complaint.
<P>You may enable your soundcard with a kernel module, as a matter of fact,
you should be able to just use the module without even recompiling
your kernel, because most GNU/Linux distributions have it already,
just type:
<P><EM>modprobe i810_audio</EM>
<P>and you should see something like this in your syslog:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.21, 21:31:04 Apr 15 2002
  i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd800 and 0xdc00, IRQ 11
  i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 2 channels.
  ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x414c:0x4710 (ALC200/200P)
  i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 supports AMAP, total channels = 2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or type
<P><EM>dmesg | less</EM> and scroll to see the kernel messages.
<P>If everything went fine, you may add <CODE>i810_audio</CODE> to
<CODE>/etc/modules</CODE> so it will autoload everytime you boot:
<P><EM>echo "i810_audio" >> /etc/modules</EM>
<P>
<P>or you like monolitic kernels (no modules), follow the step above to install
the kernel sources
and say Y to <CODE>Sound card support</CODE> and Y to <CODE>Intel ICH (i8xx) audio
support</CODE>
compile your kernel, install, reboot and now your integrated soundcard is
working.
<P>If you don't know how to compile a kernel, read the 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HOWTO</A>,
it's easy and you'll get a optimized kernel for you system, also you'll learn a
bit about that talk of using the source code (yes you are already taking
advantage of it :-)

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 lm-sensors</A>
</H2>

<H3>Getting the drivers</H3>

<P>Get the lm_sensors 2.6.2 or more recent:
<A HREF="http://www.lm-sensors.nu/archive/lm_sensors-2.6.2.tar.gz">http://www.lm-sensors.nu/archive/lm_sensors-2.6.2.tar.gz</A>
You'll need kernel sources too in order to compile that one.
<H3>Installing them</H3>

<P><EM>tar -xzvf i2c-2.6.2.tar.gz</EM>
<P><EM>cd i2c-2.6.2</EM>
<P><EM>make &amp;&amp; make install</EM>
<P>Then there was a problem when making install for me, so if it doesn't work, just
do the following:
<P><EM>cp kernel/i2c-core.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/i2c-core.o</EM>
<P><EM>cp kernel/i2c-proc.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/i2c-proc.o</EM>
<P>Now let's copy the specific driver:
<P><EM>cp kernel/chips/it87.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/it87.o</EM>
<P>ok now
<P><EM>cp prog/sensors/sensors /usr/bin/sensors</EM>
<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<P>Edit <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> and add to it the following lines:

<P>
<P>now:
<P><EM>modprobe i2c-proc</EM>
<P><EM>modprobe it87</EM>
<P><EM>modprobe i2c-isa</EM>
<P><EM>sensors</EM>
<P>should output you some data
<P>When it works, you can write it to a file, that will be loaded automatically on
boot. Under 
<A HREF="http://www.SuSE.de">SuSE</A> the file is:
<CODE>/etc/init.d/boot.local</CODE> (used to be <CODE>/sbin/init.d/</CODE>)
and you should just add: <CODE>sensors -s</CODE>
Under mandrake, the install should have created that file:
<CODE>/etc/init.d/sensors</CODE>, which you can edit freely, sensord being just a
daemon to watch over temperature and fan speed, I assume no one
will need something like that for her/his own machine.
<P>Paolo reports that in order to start up sensord on boot, he put in /etc/sysconfig/sensors:

<P>
<P>Now as root you should edit your <CODE>/etc/sensors.conf</CODE>
search for that line: <CODE>chip "it87-*"</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 lm-sensors the Debian way</A>

<P>This time you'll be forced to compile the modules.
install the source and programs:
<P><EM>apt-get install lm-sensors lm-sensors-source</EM>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 The upstream lm-sensors maintainers know of a problem using 
 lm-sensors with IBM ThinkPad computers, resulting in 
 firmware corruption.  If you are installing this package on 
 a ThinkPad, you should wait until the upstream maintainers 
 have solved this problem before building modules from it.
 For more information, see 
 /usr/share/doc/lm-sensors-source/README.thinkpad.
 IBM ThinkPad brokenness -- really install lm-sensors?
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Answer yes to this question, you can't have an IBM thinkpad and the k7s5a in the same box as far as I know!
<P><EM>cd /usr/src</EM>
<P><EM>tar xzvf lm-sensors.tar.gz</EM>
<P><EM>cd modules/lm-sensors/</EM>
<P><EM>make &amp;&amp; make install</EM>
<P>Then you should have modutils take a few arguments,
the best way is probably to use a new file, like:
/etc/modutils/sensors
with this content:

<P><EM>modprobe i2c-isa it87</EM>
<P>You can now type sensors to access to the informations (note that you should edit sensors.conf, otherwise you'll see strange and inaccurate things :] )
<P>You can also put i2c-isa and it87 in /etc/modules (one by line!) to have them be automatically loaded on boot, I don't know yet, how/whether it is possible to use some automatic loading/removing process with /etc/modules.conf

# For this family of chips the negative voltage equation is different from

# tied to a positive reference voltage.  See ITE8705/12 datasheet (SIS950
# data sheet is wrong)

# Vs = (1 + Rin/Rf) * Vin - (Rin/Rf) * Vref.
# Vref = 4.096 volts, Vin is voltage measured, Vs is actual voltage.

# The next two are negative voltages (-12 and -5).
# The following formulas must be used. Unfortunately the datasheet
# does not give recommendations for Rin, Rf, but we can back into
# them based on a nominal +2V input to the chip, together with a 4.096V Vref.

#    actual V = (Vmeasured * (1 + Rin/Rf)) - (Vref * (Rin/Rf))

I used a grey laplink parallel cable (also known as Null Printer Cable)  a friend sold me and followed the

<P>Using a modified BIOS, I was able to successfully overclock my Athlon 1000Mhz
to 1050Mhz flawlessy, but
when I messed with hdparm (30Gig Western Digital hard drive) using <EM>hdparm
-c1 -X66 /dev/hda</EM>, I managed to corrupt my filesystem, so beware.
<P>
<P>If you are a real tweaker, you might want to change your BIOS Logo and stuff,
some people tried that and it worked OK, some others
not, so they had to flash their BIOS again (blindly with a bootdisk and a
working bios in it) to make the board work again. It is really up
to you. Search Google or OC Workbench and you'll be on your way.
<P>
<P>Good Luck! :-)
<H3>Karl</H3>

<P><I>"Also i recommend you try using either the HoneyX bios or the CHEEPOman
bios for the k7s5a instead of the official release, it gives you more
control although some problems with non-atapi CD drives (my dvd goes
crazy in linux with cheepoman)</I> 
<P><I>The cheepoman bios also fixes several issues which ECS has still not
attended to.</I>
<P><I>These bios roms are unsupported by ECS please bare that in mind, also
they are meant for overclocking more than anything else, overclocking in
such a way as you don't need a pencil ;)"</I>
