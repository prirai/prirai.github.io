configuring a webcam, digital camera, or other video device in the Linux
operating system.

It outlines how to enable the necessary kernel and/or software support and
various frame-grabber applications that can be used to access your device.

It does not discuss the differences in graphic and video formats, the
features and/or capabilities of particular devices, or the encoding or

> If you have a USB webcam, it is likely a Linux driver has been written for your device.

There are two ways of supporting USB devices in Linux.

One is the more traditional kernel support, and the other is through
libusb.

For at least one webcam category, the STV0680-based models, working 
libusb support is recommended, at least according to <A
HREF="http://stv0680-usb.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>the Sourceforge page 
on the subject</A
>.</P
><P
>Unless you know your driver requires libusb support, you should probably 
stick with the more conventional in-kernel support for USB devices beginning 
in <A

></A
>2.2.1.1. Libusb</H4
><P
> Libusb is a library that allows access to the USB functions in
Linux through userspace and without the need to enable kernel support
and insert modules. 

Most distributions, at this point, are offering <A
HREF="http://libusb.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>libusb</A
> in their stable
branches (and some install it by default), so if you don't already have
kernel support for USB devices, then you may only have to install the
libusb package in order to access your device.

You must have USB device filesystem support enabled in your kernel,
which most distributions do.

The most common address is 0x378 for an x86 system; 0x278 and 0x3BC are
other possibilities for integrated or ISA parallel ports.

Add-in PCI parallel ports may have unusual base addresses.

You can also arrange multiple devices with either the parport_pc or
parport_arc modules, though that topic is beyond the scope of this

><P
> It is a good idea to be sure that your user account can access
the device once all modules are loaded and device nodes created.

The most security-conscious way to do that is to add access for a
particular group.

On my system, the members of the group 'video' are allowed to use the
webcam, scanner and other photographic devices.

The way to accomplish this is to first change the ownership of the
devices in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

> ...where <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>root.video</B
> are the owner and group
the device will now belong to.

Obviously, the specific command will vary by your system and the type
of device.

It is important that you change the ownership of the device node itself
and not the symlink; symlinks' ownerships are affected only by changing
the parent devices or files they point to.  </P
><P
> To see if your user account is a member of the group in question,
as root issue the following command:

<B

other programs installed depending on your distribution.

	is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
	license document but changing it is not allowed.</P
><P
> 0. PREAMBLE </P
><P
>	The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
	or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
	freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
	redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
	or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
	author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while
	not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</P
><P
>	This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
	works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
	It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
	cense designed for free software.</P
><P
>	We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
	free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
	free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
	that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
	software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
	of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
	We recommend this License principally for works in which its
	purpose is instruction or reference.</P
><P
> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS </P
><P
>	This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
	that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
	it can be distributed under the terms of this License.	Such a
	notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
	duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
	The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
	Any member of the public is a licensee and is addressed as "you".
	You accept the license if you copy, modify, or distribute the
	work in a way, thus requiring permission under copyright law.</P
><P
>	A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
	the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
	modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>	A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
	section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
	relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
	Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
	nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
	(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
	a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
	relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
	the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
	philosophical, ethical, or political position regarding them.</P
><P
>	The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections in which
	titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
	in the notice that says that the Document is released under
	this License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
	Secondary, then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
	The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
	does not identify any Invariant Sections, then there are none.</P
><P
>	The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
	listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
	that says that the Document is released under this License.
	A Front-Cover Text may be at most five words, and a Back-Cover
	Text may be at most 25 words.</P
><P
>	A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
	copy, represented in a format where its specification is available
	to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
	straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
	composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
	widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
	to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
	formats suitable for input to text formatters.	A copy made in an
	otherwise Transparent file format in which its markup, or absence
	of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
	modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
	is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.
	A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>	Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
	plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX
	input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
	standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
	human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
	PNG, XCF, and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats
	that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
	SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
	generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript
	or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>	The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
	plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
	material this License requires to appear in the title page.
	For works in formats, which do not have any title page as such,
	"Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
	the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</P
><P
>	A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
	in which its title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ
	in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
	language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
	below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements",
	or "History".)	To "Preserve the Title" of such a section,
	when you modify the Document, means that it remains a section
	"Entitled XYZ", according to this definition.</P
><P
>	The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
	which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
	Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
	in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
	any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have
	is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.</P
><P
> 2. VERBATIM COPYING </P
><P
>	You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
	commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
	copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
	applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
	you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
	You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
	reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
	However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
	If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
	follow the conditions in section 3.</P
><P
>	You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
	and you may publicly display copies.</P
><P
> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY </P
><P
>	If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
	have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
	and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
	enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
	all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover,
	and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
	clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
	The front cover must present the full title with all words of the
	title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
	on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
	covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
	satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
	other respects.</P
><P
>	If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
	fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as
	fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
	adjacent pages.</P
><P
>	If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the
	Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a
	machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
	or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location
	from which the general network-using public has access to download
	using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
	copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
	latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
	you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
	that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
	stated location until at least one year after the last time you
	distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
	retailers) of that edition to the public.</P
><P
>	It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
	of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
	copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
	version of the Document.</P
><P
> 4. MODIFICATIONS </P
><P
>	You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
	under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that
	you release the Modified Version under precisely this License,
	with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document,
	thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified
	Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you
	must do these things in the Modified Version:</P
><P
>	A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
	distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
	versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
	History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
	as a previous version if the original publisher of that version
	gives permission.</P
><P
>	B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
	entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
	Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
	authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
	fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.</P
><P
>	C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
	Modified Version, as the publisher.</P
><P
>	D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</P
><P
>	E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
	adjacent to the other copyright notices.</P
><P
>	F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
	notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
	under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
	Addendum below.</P
><P
>	G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
	Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
	license notice.</P
><P
>	H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.</P
><P
>	I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
	and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
	authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
	the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History"
	in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
	and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
	add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
	previous sentence.</P
><P
>	J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
	for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document and
	likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
	versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History"
	section.  You may omit a network location for a work that was
	published at least four years before the Document itself, or
	if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
	permission.</P
><P
>	K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
	Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
	the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
	and/or dedications given therein.</P
><P
>	L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
	in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
	equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</P
><P
>	M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".	Such a section
	may not be included in the Modified Version.</P
><P
>	N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
	"Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</P
><P
>	O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.  If the Modified Version
	includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify
	as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
	Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
	sections as invariant.	To do this, add their titles to the list
	of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
	These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
	You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
	contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
	various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
	the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
	definition of a standard.</P
><P
>	You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
	Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text,
	to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.
	Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
	may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.
	If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
	previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
	entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
	but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
	the previous publisher that added the old one.</P
><P
>	The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
	License give permission to use their names for publicity for or
	to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</P
><P
> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS </P
><P
>	You may combine the Document with other documents released under
	this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
	modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
	all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
	unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
	combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
	their Warranty Disclaimers.</P
><P
>	The combined work need only contain one copy of this License,
	and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with
	a single copy.	If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
	the same name but different contents, make the title of each
	such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
	the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
	known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
	section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
	notice of the combined work.</P
><P
>	In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
	"History" in the various original documents, forming one section
	Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
	"Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
	You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</P

> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS </P
><P
>	You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
	documents released under this License, and replace the individual
	copies of this License in the various documents with a single
	copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
	the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
	documents in all other respects.</P
><P
>	You may extract a single document from such a collection and
	distribute it individually under this License, provided you
	insert a copy of this License into the extracted document and
	follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
	copying of that document.</P
><P
> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS </P
><P
>	A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
	separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
	copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
	legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
	works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate,
	this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate
	which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</P
><P
>	If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
	copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
	half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
	placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
	or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
	electronic form.  Otherwise, they must appear on printed covers
	that bracket the whole aggregate.</P
><P
> 8. TRANSLATION </P
><P
>	Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
	distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
	section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
	requires special permission from their copyright holders, but
	you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections
	in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
	You may include a translation of this License, and all the license
	notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
	that you also include the original English version of this License
	and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.
	In case of a disagreement between the translation and the
	original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer,
	the original version will prevail.</P
><P
>	If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
	"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
	Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
	the actual title.</P
><P
> 9. TERMINATION </P
><P
>	You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
	except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
	attempt to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
	is void and will automatically terminate your rights under
	this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
	rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
	terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</P
><P
> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE </P
><P
>	The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
	the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
	versions will be similar in spirit to the present version
	but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
	See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</P
><P
>	Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
	number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
	version of this License "or any later version" applies to it,
	you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
	of that specified version or of any later version that has
	been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
	If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
	you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
	by the Free Software Foundation.</P
><P
> ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents </P
><P
>	To use this License in a document you have written, include
	a copy of the License in the document and put the following
	copyright and license notices just after the title page:</P
><P
>	Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.  Permission is granted to copy,
	distribute, and/or modify this document under the terms of the
	GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version
	published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant
	Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy
	of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
	Documentation License".</P
><P
>	If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
	Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this: with the
	Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover
	Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
	If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
	combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit
	the situation.</P
><P
>	If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code,
	we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
	choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
	License, to permit their use in free software.</P
