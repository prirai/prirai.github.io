>The same questions get asked repeatedly on Linux related mailing lists and news groups.
		Many of them arise because people don't know as much as they should about how things "work" on
		Linux, at least, as far as games go.  Gaming can be a tough pursuit; it requires knowledge from
		an incredibly vast range of topics from compilers to libraries to system administration to
		networking to XFree86 administration ...  you get the picture.  Every aspect of your computer
		plays a role in gaming.  It's a demanding topic, but this fact is shadowed by the primary goal
		of gaming: to have fun and blow off some steam.</P
><P
>This document is a stepping stone to get the most common problems resolved and to give
		people the knowledge to begin thinking intelligently about what is going on with their games.
		Just as with anything else on Linux, you need to know a little more about what's going on behind
		the scenes with your system to be able to keep your games healthy or to diagnose and fix them
		when they're not.</P

>Back then, text adventures were self contained executables on  a disk or casette.  These
			days there's usually a data file and an interpreter.  The interpreter reads data files and
			provides the gaming interface.  The data files are the actual game itself, similar to the
			relationship between first person shooters (<A
HREF="#FPS"
>Section 2.7</A
>) and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>wad</TT
> files.</P
><P
>The first adventure game was Adventure (actually &#8220;ADVENT&#8221;, written on a
			PDP-1 in 1972).  You can play Adventure yourself (actually, a descendent); it comes with
			&#8220;bsd games&#8221; on most Linux distros.  Text adventures became popularized by Scott
			Adams (<A
HREF="#SCOTTADAMS"
>Section 11.5</A
>) and reached their height of popularity in the late 80's
			with Infocom (<A
HREF="#INFOCOM"
>Section 11.4</A
>) which are also playable under Linux.</P
><P
>As computer graphics became easier and more powerful, text adventures gave rise to
			graphic adventures.  The death of commercial interactive fiction more or less coincided with the
			bankruptcy of Infocom.</P

>2.4. Graphical Adventures</H2
><P
>Graphical adventures are, at heart, text adventures on steroids.  The degree to which
			they use graphics varies widely.  Back in the 80's, they were little more than text adventures
			which showed a screen of static graphics.  When you picked up an item, the background would be
			redrawn without the item appearing.  The canonical example would be the so-called `Hi-Res
			Adventures' like The Wizard And The Princess.  Later on, the sophisticated graphical
			adventures had your character roaming around the screen, and you could even use a mouse, but
			the interface remained purely text.</P
><P
>Next there are the `point and click adventures' which basically have no text interface
			at all, and often have dynamic graphics, like a cat wandering around the room while you're
			deciding what to do next.  In these games, you point at an object (say, a book) and can choose
			from a pull-down list of functions.  Kind of like object oriented adventuring.  :)  There
			aren't many graphical adventures written natively for Linux.  The only one I can think of is
			Hopkins FBI (which happens to be my favorite game for Linux).</P

>2.5. Simulation (aka Sims)</H2
><P
>Simulations strive to immerse the player behind the controls of something they normally
			wouldn't have access to.  This could be something real like a fighter jet or something
			imaginary like a mechanized warrior combat unit.  In either case, sims strive for
			realism.</P
><P
>Some sims have little or no strategy.  They simply put you in a cockpit to give you the
			thrill of piloting a plane.  Some are considerably complex, and there's often a fine line
			between sims and strats (<A
HREF="#STRATEGY"
>Section 2.6</A
>).  A good example would be Heavy Gear III
			or Flight Gear.  These days sims and strats are nearly indistinguishable, but a long time ago,
			sims were real time while strats were turn based.  This is awkward for modern day use, since a
			game like Warcraft which everyone knows as a strat, would be a sim by definition.</P

NAME="STRATEGY"
></A
>2.6. Strategy (aka Strats)</H2
><P
>Strategy games have their roots in old Avalon type board games like Panzer Leader and
			old war strategy games published by SSI.  Generally, they simulate some kind of scenario.  The

			scenario can be peaceful, like running a successful city (SimCity), or not, like illegal
			drug selling operation (DrugWars) or an all-out war strategy game like Myth II.  The types
			of games usually take a long time to complete and require a lot of brainpower.</P
><P
>Strats can be further divided into two classes: real time and turn based.  Real time
			strats are based on the concept of you-snooze-you-lose.  For example, you're managing a city
			and a fire erupts somewhere.  The more time it takes for you mobilize the fire fighters, the
			more damage the fire does.  Turn based strats are more like chess---the computer takes a turn
			and then the player takes a turn.</P

>OpenGL is not only an API, it's also an implementation, written by SGI.  The
			implementation tries to use hardware acceleration for various graphics operations whenever
			available, which depends on what videocard you have in you computer.  If hardware acceleration
			is not possible for a specific task, OpenGL falls back on software rendering.  This means that
			when you get OpenGL from SGI, if you want any kind of hardware acceleration at all, it must be
			OpenGL written and compiled specifically for some graphics card.  Otherwise, all you'll get is
			software rendering.  The same thing is true for OpenGL clones, like Mesa.</P

			implementation conforming to the ARB specifications.  It's reported that Mesa is even faster
			than SGI's own OpenGL implementation.</P
><P
>Just like OpenGL, Mesa makes use of hardware acceleration whenever possible.  When a
			particular graphics task isn't able to be hardware accelerated by the video card, it's
			software rendered; the task is done by your computer's CPU instead.  This means that there are
			different builds of Mesa depending on what kind of video card you have.  Each build uses a
			different library as a backend renderer.  For example, if you have a Voodoo I, II or III card
			under XFree86 3.x, you'd use mesa+glide2 (written by David Bucciarelli) which is the Mesa

>As you can see, this gives us slighly different results. The NWN library directories

CLASS="FILENAME"
>libmss.so.6</TT
> in the "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>./miles</TT
>"
			directory, and also finds the local copy of libSDL first, no longer using the system
			copy.</P
><P
>There's another benefit of these scripts: they are easily edited to allow you to provide
			your own copy of a library.  Any game-supplied copy of a library such as OpenAL or SDL is
			likely to be compiled for the lowest common denominator, probably i486 or i686. If you have a
			Pentium4 or an AthlonXP, you could compile you own version specifically for your processor.
			The compiler will try to optimise the resulting binary, giving some increase in performance.
			See the homepage for GCC for more information this at <A

><P
>Making NWN use your system copy is easy.  It says so in the wrapper script!  Remove
			"./lib:" from the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT
> line, and you're good to go.</P
><P
>Another nice little trick is for games that use OpenAL for their sound output (e.g.
			Unreal based games: UT, Postal, Rune, etc.).  Since the Open Sound System's (OSS) deprecation
			in favour of ALSA, all Linux distributions I've seen now ship with ALSA support as default,
			with OSS support actually being supplied via ALSA's compatability modules.  The copies of
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>openal.so</TT
> distributed with games often do NOT support
			ALSA, so making the game use a copy compiled yourself will allow you to use ALSA

>7.1. History</H2
><P
>Once upon a time, a company in San Jose, California named 3dfx Interactive was king of
			the gaming video card market.  In October 1996 they released the Voodoo I, which was a
			phenomenal success.  It was the first hardware accelerated card, but only rendered 3D; it had
			to be piggybacked with a 2D video card.  The idea was that 2D rendering was handled by a high
			quality 2D video card (Matrox was immensely popular at the time) but 3D information (see
			Glide2, <A
HREF="#GLIDE2"
>Section 3.1</A
>) would be passed to the Voodoo I and rendered, using the
			Voodoo's fast hardware to perform the necessary graphics calculations.  They released the
			Voodoo Rush in April 1996.  It should've been a more powerful card, with a 50MHz GPU and 8MB
			of RAM.  Even better, it was their first combined 2D/3D card, meaning that it freed up a
			valuable PCI slot (most PC's only had a couple of PCI slots back then) but the Rush wasn't as
			popular.  3dfx removed the multi-texturing unit from the Rush, and it was outperformed by the
			Voodoo I.  At the time, ATI had their Rage series and nVidia had their Riva 128, but the
			Voodoo I blew them all away.</P
><P
>This was a good time for Linux.  id Software's open sourced the Doom codebase and ported
			Quake I to Linux (December 1996).  We were getting our first tastes of real commercial gaming.
			Life was simple: you purchased a Voodoo.  And it felt good, because 3dfx open sourced their
			drivers.  The king of video cards worked with Linux developers.  Not only did we have the best
			video cards, but the drivers were all open source.</P
><P
>In March 1998, 3dfx released their Voodoo II, with its 3.6GB/sec memory bandwith, 12MB
			of video memory and 90MHz core.  It supported resolutions up to 1024x768.  This was 3dfx in
			its heyday.  Like the Voodoo I, the Voodoo II was a 3D only card, and piggy backed with a 2D
			video card.  The Voodoo Banshee was released in September 1998 as a combined 2D/3D card, like
			the Rush.  Despite the faster 100MHz core, the Banshee was outperformed by the Voodoo II
			because its multi-texturing unit was removed, like with the Rush.  And again like the Rush, it
			wasn't popular.  But 3dfx reigned supreme, and nobody could touch them.</P
><P
>In April 1999, the Voodoo III was released.  There were a number of Voodoo III's,
			ranging from a 143MHz core speed to 183MHz.  There were TV-out versions.  There were PCI and
			AGP versions (it was the first AGP video card).  It was another success, but 3dfx began to
			lose ground to nVidia, which released their TNT 2.  The TNT 2 outperformed the Voodoo II, and
			accelerated 3D graphics at full 32 bit color, while the Voodoo's were stuck at 16 bit color.
			But life was still good for Linux.  We had a card that was almost neck-to-neck with nVidia,
			our drivers were open source, and in December 1999, id Software gave us a huge gift: they open
			sourced the Quake I codebase.</P
><P
>Then nVidia released the GeForce 256 in October 1999.  3dfx's Voodoo IV, its direct
			competitor, was about a year late which is very bad when you're competing for a bleeding edge
			market.  While nVidia was putting real R&#38;D into their cards, 3dfx was simply adding more
			and faster RAM.  The Voodoo IV and V rendered in full 32bpp color, had great AA support (<A
HREF="#AA"
>Section 7.4.3</A
>), featured a 2nd GPU, more memory, and was arguably the king of of video cards.
			However, 3dfx's late release of the Voodoo IV and V coupled with the fact that the GeForce
			could be had for half the price meant that 3dfx was sinking fast.  For Linux, the newest
			Voodoo's could only accelerate at 16 and 24 bit color.  Worse still, the Voodoo V's 2nd GPU
			was unused by the Linux driver (and to this day, the Voodoo V is functionally equivalent to
			the single GPU Voodoo IV on Linux).  Most Windows users were switching to nVidia, and despite
			the fact that the nVidia drivers were proprietary, even Linux users began to jump onto the
			nVidia bandwagon.  VA Linux, the largest Linux server vendor, put nVidia into their
			machines.</P
><P
>Then in April 2000, 3dfx was attacked on a different front: ATI started releasing their
			first generation Radeons.  Until this point, ATI had always been an innovative (they developed
			their own 3D acceleration chips in 1996, about the same time as 3dfx), but sleepy graphics
			chipset manufacturer.  The Radeons were their first 3D accelerated card that gamers took any
			real serious interest in.  Their Radeons trounced both nVidia and 3dfx.  They worked with
			Linux developers, open sourced all their drivers and were hailed as the great hope for Linux
			gaming.  nVidia came back with fists swinging, and this was all too much for 3dfx.  Between
			losing the benchmark wars to the GeForce and Radeon, their lateness with new cards and high
			prices, 3dfx lost its market share and didn't have the funds to stay into business.  On April
			18 2001, they sold most of their assets and technology to nVidia, and in October 2002, they
			finally declared bankruptcy.</P
><P
>The demise of 3dfx was quite sudden and a slap in the face to the open source community.
			I still remember my friend Gabe Rosa emailing me with just "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Look at /.</TT
>" and
			seeing the news.  It was the 2nd worst day for Linux gaming (the 1st being the demise of
			Loki).  And it was also a shame.  3dfx was getting ready to release a new Voodoo V featuring 4
			GPU's which would've trounced the ATI and  nVidia offerings, as well as a new card code named
			"Rampage" which reportedly would've put them firmly back as the king of the hill.  There are
			reports that the Rampage's technology (which was sold to nVidia) went into the GeForce 5900.
			Not too shabby for 3 year old technology!</P
><P
>At first, things were still simple.  Linux gamers would either keep their open source
			Voodoos, get an open source Radeon or a closed source GeForce.  However, with bigger and
			better games on the horizon, it was only a matter of time before the Voodoos would no longer
			be a viable graphics card for modern gaming.  People were still using Voodoo's, but they were
			essentially out of the game at this point.</P
><P
>ATI started to release a tremendous number of versions of each video card, and keeping
			up with them and their terminology started to become very difficult.  ATI, together with
			nVidia, played king of hill.  Their products have been neck to neck ever since, with GeForce
			taking the lead a bit more times than the Radeon.  But the Radeon's drivers were open source,
			so many Linux users stuck by them.  Then things got even more complicated.</P
><P
>ATI started becoming more and more reluctant to open source drivers for their new
			releases, and suddenly, it wasn't clear who the "good guy" was anymore.  nVidia's party line
			was they license some of their GL code from another company, and is thus non-releasable.
			Presumably, ATI doesn't want to release drivers to keep their trade secrets, well, a secret.
			And it gets worse.  The ATI Linux drivers have been plagued by extremely poor performance.
			Even when an ATI offering is better than the current GeForce offering for Windows, the card is
			always trounced by GeForce on Linux.  Because of the ATI Linux driver woes, Linux users cannot
			use MS Windows based benchmarks or card stats.  They simply don't apply to us.  And that's
			pretty much where we are right now.</P
><P
>As a last note, the only systematic Linux video card benchmarking effort I'm aware of
			was done, unfortunately, in March 2001, between a Radeon 32 DDR and a GeForce 2.  You can read
			it for yourself at <A

TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxhardware.org/features/01/03/19/0357219.shtml</A

			that the GeForce 2 firmly and soundly trounced the Radeon 32 DDR.</P

><P
>nVidia's latest offering is the GeForce 5900, based on the NV35 chipset.  It's well
			supported by Linux with high quality but proprietary drivers.  nVidia uses a convenient
			combined driver architecture; their driver will support the TNT 2 all the way up to the
			GeForce 5900.  Although their drivers are closed source, as a company, nVidia has been
			supportive and good to Linux users.</P
><P
>ATI's has worked with Linux developers for their Radeons up to and including the Radeon
			9200, which have 2D and 3D support in XFree86.  I'm not entirely sure of the quality of these
			open source drivers, however, Soldier of Fortune I and Heavy Metal still have opaque texture
			problems under first generation Radeons.  Beyond the 9200, you need to use ATI's binary only
			proprietary drivers, available in rpm format from ATI's website.  It's claimed that these
			drivers are piss poor; a friend of mine claims his GeForce 4400 outperforms his Radeon 9700
			pro.  That's shameful.</P
><P
>On paper, and in the Windows benchmarks, the Radeon 9800 trounces the ill-conceived
			GeForce 5800 and slightly edges out the GeForce 5900.  On paper, it's simply the more
			impressive card.  But again, the driver issue makes this information unusable for us.  If you
			have your heart set to buy the best card for Linux, you'll want to go with the GeForce
			5900.</P

				smooth curve or line, jagged.  AA uses CPU intensive filtering to smooth out these jagged
				edges.  This improves a game's visuals, but can also dramatically degrade
				performance.</P
><P
>AA is used in a number of situations.  For instance, when you magnify a picture,
				you'll notice lines that were once smooth become jagged (try it with The Gimp).  Font
				rendering is another big application for AA.</P
><P
>AA can be done either by the application itself (as with The Gimp or the XFree86 font
				system) or by hardware, if your video card supports it.  Since AA is CPU intensive, it's
				more desirable to perform it in hardware, but if we're talking about semi-static

>When I talk about 'performance hits', keep in mind that the performance hit depends on
				what resolution you're running at.  For instance, at a low resolution you may get only a

				hardware wherever possible.</P
><P
>Every object has a stacking order, like a deck of cards.  When objects are rendered
				into a 2D frame buffer, the rendering engine removes hidden surfaces by using the Z buffer.
				There are two approaches to this.  Dumb engines draw far objects first and close objects
				last, obscuring objects below them in the Z buffer.  Smart engines calculate what portions
				of objects will be obscured by objects above them and simply not render the portions that
				you won't see anyhow.  For complicated textures this is a huge savings in processor

			concept of what "best sound card" would mean.  If you're a musician, you might want to check
			out the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/quality/"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Audio Quality
			HOWTO</A
>.</P
><P
>Now that Linux is beginning to mature, this question isn't as important as it used to
			be.  Once upon a time, soundcards without onboard MIDI chips (most PCI sound cards) didn't do
			MIDI.  This was mostly a problem for things like xdoom or lxdoom using musserv.  These days we
			have MIDI emulators like Timidity and libraries like SDL which don't require hardware MIDI
			support.  Frankly, I've had many cards and I can't tell the difference between any of them for
			gaming.  If you want to do things like convert a record LP to digital format, then your choice
			of a soundcard with a professional grade A/D converter is absolutely crucial.  For this HOWTO,
			we'll assume that you're more of a gamer than a studio recording engineer.</P
><P
>Your decision should be based on what will be the easiest to configure.  If you already
			have a card and it works well, that's good enough.  If you're in the market to buy a sound
			card, get something that will take you a second to configure.  PCI cards are much easier to
			deal with than ISA since you don't need to tell their drivers about which system resources
			(IRQ, DMA, I/O addresses) to use.  Some ISA cards ARE plug-n-play, like the Creative AWE-64,
			and the Linux kernel has come a long way in auto configuring them.</P
><P
>My personal recommendation is any card which has the es1370 or es1371 chip, which uses
			the es1370 and es1371 sound drivers on Linux.  These cards include the older Ensoniq es1370
			and newer Creative PCI-128.  These cards are extremely cheap and trivial to get working under
			Linux.</P
><P
>I used to be a fan of the Creative Soundblaster AWE 32, AWE 64 and AWE 64 gold
			soundcards.  These ISA PnP cards are well supported by both OSS and Alsa.  They all use the
			same E-mu 8000 synthesis chip which enables them to play 32 voices simultaneously (they have
			32 "channels").  A few notes: First, the Soundblaster AWE HOWTO is very out of date.  Second,
			the AWE 64 and AWE 64 gold can play 64 voices simultaneously, but this is done in software.
			Creative never released a Linux driver for these cards (and they never released programming
			information to Linux developers), so Linux users cannot use the extra 32 channels on the AWE
			64 and AWE 64 gold.  As far Linux users are concerned, all three cards are completely
			identical (although the AWE 64 gold has gold plated connectors, which are better for sound
			quality than the more common steel connectors).</P
><P
>The Creative Soundblaster Live! is an extremely popular PCI sound card these days.  I've
			never owned one, so I cannot comment here.  However, there have been numerous reports about
			serious problems with the Live! and AMD motherboards that use the 686b southbridge.  A google
			search should turn up alot of information on this problem.</P
><P
>A more relevent issue is speakers, but even here the difference isn't huge.  I've had
			expensive Altec Lansing speakers perform only slightly better than el-cheapo speakers.  You
			get what you pay for with speakers, but don't expect a huge difference.  You'll want to get
			something with a separate sub-woofer; this does make a difference at a cost of extra power and
