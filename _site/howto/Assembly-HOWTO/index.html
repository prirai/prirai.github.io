><P
>This document aims answering questions of those
who program or want to program 32-bit x86 assembly using
<EM
>free software</EM
>,
particularly under the Linux operating system.
At many places Universal Resource Locators (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>URL</SPAN
>) are given
for some software or documentation repository.
This document also points to other documents about
non-free, non-x86, or non-32-bit assemblers,
although this is not its primary goal.
Also note that there are FAQs and docs about programming
on your favorite platform (whatever it is), which you should consult
for platform-specific issues, not related directly to assembly programming.</P
><P
>Because the main interest of assembly programming is to build
the guts of operating systems, interpreters, compilers, and games,
where C compiler fails to provide the needed expressiveness
(performance is more and more seldom as issue),
we are focusing on development of such kind of software.</P
><P

>Assembly is a very low-level language
(the lowest above hand-coding the binary instruction patterns).
This means

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>it is long and tedious to write initially</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>it is quite bug-prone</P
></LI
><LI

>your code can be fairly difficult to understand and modify,
i.e. to maintain</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>the result is non-portable to other architectures,
existing or upcoming</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>your code will be optimized only for a certain implementation
of a same architecture:
for instance, among Intel-compatible platforms
each CPU design and its variations
(relative latency, through-output, and capacity,
of processing units, caches, RAM, bus, disks,
presence of FPU, MMX, 3DNOW, SIMD extensions, etc)
implies potentially completely different optimization techniques.
CPU designs already include:
Intel 386, 486, Pentium, PPro, PII, PIII, PIV;
Cyrix 5x86, 6x86, M2; AMD K5, K6 (K6-2, K6-III), K7 (Athlon, Duron).
New designs keep popping up, so don't expect either this listing
and your code to be up-to-date.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>you spend more time on a few details
and can't focus on small and large algorithmic design,
that are known to bring the largest part of the speed up
(e.g. you might spend some time building very fast
list/array manipulation primitives in assembly;
only a hash table would have sped up your program much more;
or, in another context, a binary tree;
or some high-level structure distributed over a cluster of CPUs)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>a small change in algorithmic design might completely
invalidate all your existing assembly code.
So that either you're ready (and able) to rewrite it all,
or you're tied to a particular algorithmic design</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>On code that ain't too far from what's in standard benchmarks,
commercial optimizing compilers outperform hand-coded assembly
(well, that's less true on the x86 architecture than on RISC architectures,
and perhaps less true for widely available/free compilers;
anyway, for typical C code, GCC is fairly good);</P

you'll find that not so much of it is required,

as little assembly as needed,

Even a successful game like DOOM was almost massively written in C,
with a tiny part only being written in assembly for speed up.</P

>2.2.2. Languages with optimizing compilers</H2
><P
>Languages like ObjectiveCAML, SML, CommonLISP, Scheme, ADA, Pascal, C, C++,
among others, all have free optimizing compilers
that will optimize the bulk of your programs,
and often do better than hand-coded assembly even for tight loops,
while allowing you to focus on higher-level details,
and without forbidding you to grab
a few percent of extra performance in the above-mentioned way,
once you've reached a stable design.
Of course, there are also commercial optimizing compilers
for most of these languages, too!</P
><P
>Some languages have compilers that produce C code,
which can be further optimized by a C compiler:
LISP, Scheme, Perl, and many other.
Speed is fairly good.</P

>2.2.3. General procedure to speed your code up</H2

>As for speeding code up,
you should do it only for parts of a program
that a profiling tool has consistently identified
as being a performance bottleneck.</P
><P
>Hence, if you identify some code portion as being too slow, you should

<P

lots of options in most compilers, etc).</P

></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>Finally, before you end up writing assembly,
you should inspect generated code,
to check that the problem really is with bad code generation,
as this might really not be the case:
compiler-generated code might be better than what you'd have written,
particularly on modern multi-pipelined architectures!
Slow parts of a program might be intrinsically so.
The biggest problems on modern architectures with fast processors
are due to delays from memory access, cache-misses, TLB-misses,
and page-faults;
register optimization becomes useless,
and you'll more profitably re-think data structures and threading
to achieve better locality in memory access.
Perhaps a completely different approach to the problem might help, then.</P

This works with most Unix compilers,
including the GNU C Compiler (GCC), but YMMV.
As for GCC, it will produce more understandable assembly code with
the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-fverbose-asm</TT

Of course, if you want to get good assembly code,
don't forget your usual optimization options and hints!</P

>2.3. Linux and assembly</H1
><P
>As you probably noticed, in general case
you don't need to use assembly language in Linux programming.
Unlike DOS, you do not have to write Linux drivers in assembly
(well, actually you can do it if you really want).
And with modern optimizing compilers,
if you care of speed optimization for different CPU's,
it's much simpler to write in C.
However, if you're reading this,
you might have some reason to use assembly instead of C/C++.</P
><P
>You may <EM
>need</EM
> to use assembly, or you may <EM
>want</EM
> to use assembly.
In short, main practical (<EM
>need</EM
>) reasons
of diving into the assembly realm are <EM
>small code</EM
>
and <EM
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> independence</EM
>.
Impractical (<EM
>want</EM
>), and the most often reason is
being just an old crazy hacker,
who has twenty years old habit of doing everything in assembly language.</P
><P
>However, if you're porting Linux to some embedded hardware
you can be quite short at the size of whole system:
you need to fit kernel, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
>
and all that stuff of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>(file|find|text|sh|etc.) utils</SPAN
>
into several hundreds of kilobytes,
and every kilobyte costs much.
So, one of the possible ways is to rewrite some
(or all) parts of system in assembly,
and this will really save you a lot of space.
For instance, a simple <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>httpd</B
> written in assembly
can take less than 600 bytes;
you can fit a server consisting of kernel, httpd and ftpd
in 400 KB or less... Think about it.</P

Optimizing besides it takes more time, and yields code that is much larger,

such over-optimization might be useful for tight loops only (if any),

In cases when you need really strong compiler optimization for a few files,
do consider using up to <TT

><P
><TT
CLASS="OPTION"

the stupid frame pointer maintenance, which makes code smaller and faster,

It precludes the easy use of debugging tools (<B

However, a macro would allow the name for a non local defined label

It has mostly Intel-syntax, though it differs slightly as for addressing modes.
Some time ago it was used in a several projects, including the Linux kernel,
but eventually most of those projects have moved to GAS or NASM.
AFAIK, only ELKS continues to use it.</P

in bin86 package with linker (ld86), or as separate archive.
Documentation is available as the man page and as.doc from the source package.
When in doubt, the source code itself is often a good doc: though it is not
very well commented, the programming style is straightforward.
You might try to see how as86 is(was) used in ELKS, LILO, or Tunes 0.0.0.25...</P

>A completely outdated version 0.4 of AS86 is distributed by HJLu
just to compile the Linux kernel versions prior to 2.4,

But I advise no one to use it for anything else but compiling Linux.
This version supports only a hacked minix object file format,

Moreover, the typing constructs are expressive enough to encode
most source language programming features including records and structures,
arrays, higher-order and polymorphic functions, exceptions, abstract data types,
subtyping, and modules. Just as importantly,
TAL is flexible enough to admit many low-level compiler optimizations.
Consequently, TAL is an ideal target platform for type-directed compilers
that want to produce verifiably safe code
for use in secure mobile code applications
or extensible operating system kernels.</P

>Often you will be told that using 
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>C library</SPAN
> (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>libc</SPAN
>)
is the only way, and direct system calls are bad.
This is true. To some extent.
In general, you must know that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> is not sacred,
and in <EM

then calls kernel, and then sets errno.
You can easily do this in your program as well (if you need to),
and your program will be dozen times smaller, and this will result
in improved performance as well, just because you're not using
shared libraries (static binaries are faster).
Using or not using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> in assembly programming
is more a question of taste/belief than something practical.
Remember, Linux is aiming to be POSIX compliant,
so does <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
>.
This means that syntax of almost all
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> "system calls"
exactly matches syntax of real kernel system calls (and vice versa).
Besides,
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNU libc</SPAN
>(<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>glibc</SPAN
>)
becomes slower and slower from version to version,
and eats more and more memory; and so,
cases of using direct system calls become quite usual.
However, the main drawback of throwing <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> away
is that you will possibly need to implement several
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> specific functions
(that are not just syscall wrappers) on your own
(<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>printf()</TT

and you are ready for that, aren't you? :-)</P

>Size is much better saved by having some kind

than by writing everything in assembly.
(the interpreter itself could be written either in C or assembly.)
The best way to keep multiple binaries small is
to not have multiple binaries, but instead
to have an interpreter process files with
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#!</TT
> prefix.
This is how OCaml works when used in wordcode mode
(as opposed to optimized native code mode),
and it is compatible with using the libc.
This is also how Tom Christiansen's
Perl PowerTools reimplementation of unix utilities works.
Finally, one last way to keep things small,
that doesn't depend on an external file with a hardcoded path,
be it library or interpreter,
is to have only one binary,
and have multiply-named hard or soft links to it:
the same binary will provide everything you need in an optimal space,
with no redundancy of subroutines or useless binary headers;
it will dispatch its specific behavior
according to its <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>argv[0]</I
></TT
>;
in case it isn't called with a recognized name,
it might default to a shell,
and be possibly thus also usable as an interpreter!</P

><LI
><P
>You cannot benefit from the many functionalities that libc provides
besides mere linux syscalls:
that is, functionality described in section 3 of the manual pages,

># hello.S	by Spencer T. Parkin

# This is my first MIPS-RISC assembly program!
# To compile this program type:
# &#62; gcc -o hello hello.S -non_shared

# This program compiles without errors or warnings
# on a PlayStation2 MIPS R5900 (EE Core).
# EE stands for Emotion Engine...lame!

# The -non_shared option tells gcc that we`re
# not interrested in compiling relocatable code.
# If we were, we would need to follow the PIC-
# ABI calling conventions and other protocols.

#include &#60;asm/regdef.h&#62;		// ...for human readable register names
#include &#60;asm/unistd.h&#62;		// ...for system serivices			

		.rdata					# begin read-only data segment
		.align		2			# because of the way memory is built
hello:		.asciz		"Hello, world!\n"	# a null terminated string
		.align		4			# because of the way memory is built
length:		.word		. - hello		# length = IC - (hello-addr)
		.text					# begin code segment
		.globl		main			# for gcc/ld linking
		.ent		main			# for gdb debugging info.
main:		# We must specify -non_shared to gcc or we`ll need these 3 lines that fallow.
#		.set		noreorder		# disable instruction reordering
#		.cpload		t9			# PIC ABI crap (function prologue)
#		.set		reorder			# re-enable instruction reordering
		move		a0,$0			# load stdout fd
		la		a1,hello		# load string address

		li		v0,__NR_write		# specify system write service
		syscall					# call the kernel (write string)
		li		v0,0			# load return code

>Ok you have a number of options to graphics in Linux. Which one you use
depends on what you want to do. There isn't one Web site with all the
information but here are some tips:

SVGALib: This is a C library for console SVGA access.
Pros: very easy to learn, good coding examples, not all that different
from equivalent gfx libraries for DOS, all the effects you know from DOS
can be converted with little difficulty.
Cons: programs need superuser rights to run since they write directly to
the hardware, doesn't work with all chipsets, can't run under X-Windows.
Search for svgalib-1.4.x on http://ftp.is.co.za

Framebuffer: do it yourself graphics at SVGA res
Pros: fast, linear mapped video access, ASM can be used if you want :)
Cons: has to be compiled into the kernel, chipset-specific issues, must
switch out of X to run, relies on good knowledge of linux system calls
and kernel, tough to debug
Examples: asmutils (http://www.linuxassembly.org) and the leaves example
and my own site for some framebuffer code and tips in asm
(http://ma.verick.co.za/linux4k/)

Xlib: the application and development libraries for XFree86.
Pros: Complete control over your X application
Cons: Difficult to learn, horrible to work with and requires quite a bit
of knowledge as to how X works at the low level. 
Not recommended but if you're really masochistic go for it. All the
include and lib files are probably installed already so you have what
you need. 

Low-level APIs: include PTC, SDL, GGI and Clanlib
Pros: very flexible, run under X or the console, generally abstract away
the video hardware a little so you can draw to a linear surface, lots of
good coding examples, can link to other APIs like OpenGL and sound libs,
Windows DirectX versions for free
Cons: Not as fast as doing it yourself, often in development so versions
can (and do) change frequently.
Examples: PTC and GGI have excellent demos, SDL is used in sdlQuake,
Myth II, Civ CTP and Clanlib has been used for games as well.

High-level APIs: OpenGL - any others?
Pros: clean api, tons of functionality and examples, industry standard
so you can learn from SGI demos for example
Cons: hardware acceleration is normally a must, some quirks between
versions and platforms
Examples: loads - check out www.mesa3d.org under the links section.

To get going try looking at the svgalib examples and also install SDL
and get it working. After that, the sky's the limit.</PRE

>Personally, I use gdb for debugging asmutils. Try this:
 
1) Use the following stuff to compile:
   $ nasm -f elf -g smth.asm
   $ ld -o smth smth.o

2) Fire up gdb:
   $ gdb smth

3) In gdb:
   (gdb) disassemble _start
   Place a breakpoint at _start+1 (If placed at _start the breakpoint
   wouldnt work, dunno why)
   (gdb) b *0x8048075

   To step thru the code I use the following macro:
   (gdb)define n
   &#62;ni
   &#62;printf "eax=%x ebx=%x ...etc...",$eax,$ebx,...etc...
   &#62;disassemble $pc $pc+15
   &#62;end

   Then start the program with r command and debug with n.

   Hope this helps.</PRE

Again, you can't use <TT

>int 0x10</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>int 0x13</TT
>, etc.
Fortunately almost everything can be implemented
by means of system calls or library functions.
In the worst case you may go through direct port access,
or make a kernel patch to implement needed functionality,
or use LRMI library to access BIOS functions.</P

>Yes, indeed it is. While in general it is not a good idea
(it hardly will speedup anything), there may be a need of such wizardy. 
The process of writing a module itself is not that hard --
a module must have some predefined global function,
it may also need to call some external functions from the kernel.
Examine kernel source code (that can be built as module) for details.</P

>When you call sys_open, you get back a file descriptor, which is simply an
index into a table of all the open file descriptors that your process has.
stdin, stdout, and stderr are always 0, 1, and 2, respectively, because
that is the order in which they are always open for your process from there.
Also, notice that the first file descriptor that you open yourself (w/o first
closing any of those magic three descriptors) is always 3, and they increment
from there.

Understanding the index scheme will explain what select does. When you
call select, you are saying that you are waiting certain file descriptors
to read from, certain ones to write from, and certain ones to watch from
exceptions from. Your process can have up to 1024 file descriptors open,
so an fd_set is just a bit mask describing which file descriptors are valid
for each operation. Make sense?

Since each fd that you have open is just an index, and it only needs to be
on or off for each fd_set, you need only 1024 bits for an fd_set structure.
1024 / 32 = 32 longs needed to represent the structure.

Now, for the loose example.
Suppose you want to read from a file descriptor (w/o timeout).

- Allocate the equivalent to an fd_set.  

.data

my_fds: times 32 dd 0

- open the file descriptor that you want to read from.

- set that bit in the fd_set structure.

   First, you need to figure out which of the 32 dwords the bit is in.  

   Then, use bts to set the bit in that dword. bts will do a modulo 32
   when setting the bit. That's why you need to first figure out which
   dword to start with.

   mov edx, 0
   mov ebx, 32
   div ebx

   lea ebx, my_fds
   bts ebx[eax * 4], edx

- repeat the last step for any file descriptors you want to read from.

- repeat the entire exercise for either of the other two fd_sets if you want action from them.

That leaves two other parts of the equation - the n paramter and the timeout
parameter. I'll leave the timeout parameter as an exercise for the reader
(yes, I'm lazy), but I'll briefly talk about the n parameter.

It is the value of the largest file descriptor you are selecting from (from
any of the fd_sets), plus one. Why plus one? Well, because it's easy to
determine a mask from that value. Suppose that there is data available on
x file descriptors, but the highest one you care about is (n - 1). Since
an fd_set is just a bitmask, the kernel needs some efficient way for
determining whether to return or not from select. So, it masks off the bits
that you care about, checks if anything is available from the bits that are
still set, and returns if there is (pause as I rummage through kernel source).
Well, it's not as easy as I fantasized it would be. To see how the kernel
determines that mask, look in fs/select.c in the kernel source tree.

Anyway, you need to know that number, and the easiest way to do it is to save
the value of the last file descriptor open somewhere so you don't lose it.

Ok, that's what I know. A warning about the code above (as always) is that
it is not tested. I think it should work, but if it doesn't let me know.
But, if it starts a global nuclear meltdown, don't call me. ;-)</PRE

    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</P

    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</P

>2. VERBATIM COPYING</DT
><DD
><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P
><P
>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</P
></DD
><DT
>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</DT
><DD
><P
>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</P
></DD
><DT
>4. MODIFICATIONS</DT
><DD
><P
>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="A"
><LI
><P
>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).</P
></LI
><LI

>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.</P

>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.</P
></LI

      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</P
></LI
><LI

>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.</P
></LI

      copy of this License.</P

>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.</P
></LI
><LI

>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.</P

><LI
><P
>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</P
><P
>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</P
><P
>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</P
><P
>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</P
></DD
><DT
>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</DT
><DD
><P
>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</P
><P
>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</P
><P
>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</P
></DD
><DT
>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</DT
><DD
><P
>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</P
><P
>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</P
></DD
><DT
>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</DT
><DD
><P
>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</P
><P
>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</P
></DD
><DT
>8. TRANSLATION</DT
><DD
><P
>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</P
></DD
><DT
>9. TERMINATION</DT
><DD
><P
>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</P

>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</DT
><DD
><P
>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <A

>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
