><P
>This document explains how to implement a new system call on linux 2.6. A system call is used by application (user) programs to request service from the operating system.</P

>2. System call</H1
><P
>A system call is used by application (user) programs to request service from the operating system. The following statements illustrate why system calls are needed. An operating system can access a system's hardware directly, but a user program is not given direct access to the hardware. This is done so that the kernel can keep the system safe and secure from malicious user programs. But often, a user program requires some information from the hardware (e.g., from a web camera to show you the picture), but it cannot get the information directly. So, it requests the operating system to supply it the information. This request is made by using an appropriate system call.</P
><P
></P
><P
>A system call executes in the kernel mode. Every system call has a number associated with it. This number is passed to the kernel and that's how the kernel knows which system call was made. When a user program issues a system call, it is actually calling a library routine. The library routine issues a trap to the Linux operating system by executing INT 0x80 assembly instruction. It also passes the system call number to the kernel using the EAX register. The arguments of the system call are also passed to the kernel using other registers (EBX, ECX, etc.). The kernel executes the system call and returns the result to the user program using a register. If the system call needs to supply the user program with large amounts of data, it will use another mechanism (e.g., copy_to_user call).</P

>title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following</P
><P
>text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a</P
><P
>specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",</P
><P
>"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"</P
><P
>of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a</P
><P
>section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which</P
><P
>states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty</P
><P
>Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this</P
><P
>License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other</P
><P
>implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has</P
><P
>no effect on the meaning of this License.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>2. VERBATIM COPYING</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either</P
><P
>commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the</P
><P
>copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies</P
><P
>to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other</P
><P
>conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use</P
><P
>technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further</P
><P
>copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept</P
><P
>compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough</P
><P
>number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and</P
><P
>you may publicly display copies.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</P
><P
></P
><P
>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have</P
><P
>printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the</P
><P
>Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the</P
><P
>copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover</P
><P
>Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on</P
><P
>the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify</P
><P
>you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present</P
><P
>the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and</P
><P
>visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.</P
><P
>Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve</P
><P
>the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated</P
><P
>as verbatim copying in other respects.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit</P
><P
>legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit</P
><P
>reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent</P
><P
>pages.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering</P
><P
>more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent</P
><P
>copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy</P
><P
>a computer-network location from which the general network-using</P
><P
>public has access to download using public-standard network protocols</P
><P
>a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.</P
><P
>If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,</P
><P
>when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure</P
><P
>that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated</P
><P
>location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an</P
><P
>Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that</P
><P
>edition to the public.</P
><P
></P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the</P
><P
>Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give</P
><P
>them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>4. MODIFICATIONS</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under</P
><P
>the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release</P
><P
>the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified</P
><P
>Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution</P
><P
>and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy</P
><P
>of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</P
><P
></P
><P
>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct</P
><P
>from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions</P
><P
>(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section</P
><P
>of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version</P
><P
>if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</P
><P
>B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities</P
><P
>responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified</P
><P
>Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the</P
><P
>Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),</P
><P
>unless they release you from this requirement.</P
><P
>C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the</P
><P
>Modified Version, as the publisher.</P
><P
>D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</P
><P
>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications</P
><P
>adjacent to the other copyright notices.</P
><P
>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice</P
><P
>giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the</P
><P
>terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</P
><P
>G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections</P
><P
>and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</P
><P
>H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.</P
><P
>I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add</P
><P
>to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and</P
><P
>publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If</P
><P
>there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one</P
><P
>stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as</P
><P
>given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified</P
><P
>Version as stated in the previous sentence.</P
><P
>J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for</P
><P
>public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise</P
><P
>the network locations given in the Document for previous versions</P
><P
>it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section.</P
><P
>You may omit a network location for a work that was published at</P
><P
>least four years before the Document itself, or if the original</P
><P
>publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</P
><P
>K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",</P
><P
>Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all</P
><P
>the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements</P
><P
>and/or dedications given therein.</P
><P
>L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,</P
><P
>unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers</P
><P
>or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</P
><P
>M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section</P
><P
>may not be included in the Modified Version.</P
><P
>N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"</P
><P
>or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</P
><P
>O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or</P
><P
>appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material</P
><P
>copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all</P
><P
>of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the</P
><P
>list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.</P
><P
>These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains</P
><P
>nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various</P
><P
>parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has</P
><P
>been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a</P
><P
>standard.</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a</P
><P
>passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list</P
><P
>of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of</P
><P
>Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or</P
><P
>through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already</P
><P
>includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or</P
><P
>by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,</P
><P
>you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit</P
><P
>permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License</P
><P
>give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or</P
><P
>imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this</P
><P
>License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified</P
><P
>versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the</P
><P
>Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and</P
><P
>list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its</P
><P
>license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and</P
><P
>multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single</P
><P
>copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but</P
><P
>different contents, make the title of each such section unique by</P
><P
>adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original</P
><P
>author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.</P
><P
>Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of</P
><P
>Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</P
><P
></P
><P
>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"</P
><P
>in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled</P
><P
>"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",</P
><P
>and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections</P
><P
>Entitled "Endorsements".</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents</P
><P
>released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this</P
><P
>License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in</P
><P
>the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for</P
><P
>verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute</P
><P
>it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this</P
><P
>License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all</P
><P
>other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</P
><P
></P
><P
>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate</P
><P
>and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or</P
><P
>distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright</P
><P
>resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights</P
><P
>of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.</P
><P
>When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not</P
><P
>apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves</P
><P
>derivative works of the Document.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these</P
><P
>copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of</P
><P
>the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on</P
><P
>covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the</P
><P
>electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.</P
><P
>Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole</P
><P
>aggregate.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>8. TRANSLATION</P
><P
></P
><P
>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may</P
><P
>distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.</P
><P
>Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special</P
><P
>permission from their copyright holders, but you may include</P
><P
>translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the</P
><P
>original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a</P
><P
>translation of this License, and all the license notices in the</P
><P
>Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include</P
><P
>the original English version of this License and the original versions</P
><P
>of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between</P
><P
>the translation and the original version of this License or a notice</P
><P
>or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",</P
><P
>"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve</P
><P
>its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual</P
><P
>title.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>9. TERMINATION</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except</P
><P
>as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to</P
><P
>copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will</P
><P
>automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,</P
><P
>parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this</P
><P
>License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</P
><P
>parties remain in full compliance.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</P
><P
></P
><P
>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions</P
><P
>of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new</P
><P
>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may</P
><P
>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See</P
><P
>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</P
><P
></P
><P
>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.</P
><P
>If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this</P
><P
>License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of</P
><P
>following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or</P
><P
>of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the</P
><P
>Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version</P
><P
>number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not</P
><P
>as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</P
><P
></P
><P
>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of</P
><P
>the License in the document and put the following copyright and</P
><P
>license notices just after the title page:</P
><P
></P
><P
>Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.</P
><P
>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document</P
><P
>under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2</P
><P
>or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;</P
><P
>with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.</P
><P
>A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU</P
><P
>Free Documentation License".</P
><P
></P
><P
>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,</P
><P
>replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</P
><P
></P
><P
>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the</P
><P
>Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other</P
><P
>combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the</P
><P
>situation.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we</P
><P
>recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of</P
><P
>free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,</P
><P
>to permit their use in free software.</P
