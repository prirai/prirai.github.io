>1. Introduction</H1
><P
>Why do you need Xinerama ? And what is it ? The Xinerama extensions were introduced to the XFree86 system in version 4.0.  Xinerama is an extension to XFree86 Release 6 Version 4.0 (X4.0) which allows applications and window managers to use the two (or more) physical displays as one large virtual display. </P
><P
>The beauty of the Xinerama extensions is that they are totally transparent to user space.  Previously,  applications could only reside on one of the displays and could not be moved between the two.  Window managers had to be specially written to support the two displays.  With Xinerama, window managers and applications don't have to be specially written to support the larger "Virtual Desktop" which Xinerama creates.</P

><P
>This is not meant to be a guide on how to set up your specific monitor,  or videocard.  In fact,  I assume that you already have X Window running for your setup.  Please refer to the XF86 Documentation for more information. </P
><P
>If you are using a single multiheaded card you will need to refer to your video card manufacturers instructions.  I know that both nVidia and Matrox support Linux multihead setups.  nVidia includes some documentation with their drivers, but I don't have one of these cards to test with so I don't have any specific details. </P
><P
>As far as I know,  there are no limits to which video cards you can configure this way,  nor does it seem to matter if you mix different types of video cards in a setup,  The sample configuration I use in this documentation uses two different video cards,  an AGP Fire GL 1000 and a PCI Matrox Millenium II.  What effect this has on 3d Accelleration I don't know as I don't currently accellerate either of my video cards.</P
><P
>This Howto assumes that you know how to edit text files,  do basic video card configuration for X Window, add and remove hardware from your system, start and stop system services, and follow simple instructions.  If feel you will have trouble with any of these things,  please seek help.  I am not responsible if you damage any of your stuff.</P

>3.2. Design Considerations</H2
><P
>It is possible to have each physical screen in your Xinerama setup to have a different resolution. There are some advantages to this,  I was able to use an old monitor which only operates at 640x480,  and a bigger 17" at 1280x1024 in my setup.  I have also heard of web developers and graphics designed who use one big "preview" screen and flank it with one or two smaller screens.  I think this flexibility is one of the great things about the Xinerama extensions.  </P
><P
>There are several UI issues which are specific to Xinerama with most current generation window managers (see <A
HREF="#WINDOWMANAGERS"
>Section 9</A
>) do not address well.  The most anoying is the poor handling of dead areas. </P
><P
>Window managers assume the display area is a rectangle equal in size to the heighth and width of your total desktop.  If you use more than one display resolution in a Xinerama setup your desktop will be non-rectangular. This results in "dead areas", areas which do not exist on your display,  but window manager interpret as "Empty".  Many window managers will try to utilize this dead area for new windows.  The result is windows which are inaccessable.  As window managers become Xinerama aware and this problem will go away quickly.  </P
><P
>Window managers also don't handle the concept of maximizing a window when you are running Xinerama.  Usually what happens is it maximizes your window across all available screens.  Having Netscape spread across 2 displays is generally not the best way to surf the net.</P
><P
>Unlike with screen resolotion, Xinerama limits your entire virtual screen to one color depth.  If you were planning on pulling out a cheap video card for your second display you need to keep this in mind.  If your old video card only supports 8 bit color you might get a bigger display but most newer programs look lousy in 256 colors.</P

>3.3. Layout</H2
><P
>Layout decisions are fairly simple,  you just need to decide how you want to physically lay out your monitors.  Most people will simply place their monitors in a row and view their desktop as one giant monitor.  It is also possible to overlap displays, or place them in more complex layouts.  Keep in mind though what I said above about window managers expecting rectangular displays.</P

I will assume that you are working with the XF86Config file from here out.  If you are working with XF86Config-4 or if your XF86Config file is located somewhere other than /etc/X11 you will need to adjust the commands accordingly.  </P

>Now you need to edit the ServerLayout Section at the end of the XF86Config File.  The ServerLayour Section is exactally that,  it tells you what Screens to use, how to lay them out logically, and what input devices to assign to them.  Your current layout is for one screen, keyboard, and mouse.  For each Screen section you have created about you need reference in this section for them to appear in your display.</P

><P
>As I mentioned above,  a window manager does not need to be written to support Xinerama.  However there are certain enhancements which window manager developers can do to make Xinerama users lives easier.  Features which I thought were desireable include:</P
><P
>* Intelligent placement of windows. </P
><P
> - Window managers should not place windows in dead areas or across the borders of two heads. </P
><P
> - New windows should be placed in the current desktop.</P
><P
>* Maximizing windows should maximize the window to the current head only.</P
><P
>* Window Movements should have edge resistance between heads (Much like they have resistance to other windows).</P
><P
>* Dialogs and informative messages should not pop up Between Heads. </P
><P
>In my older howto I had listed a lot of Window Managers and their level of support for Xinerama.  But most of that information is obsolete now.  Most modern window managers support Xinerama to some extent.  </P
