>There is a large body of good-practice traditions for
open-source code that helps other people port, use, and cooperate with
developing it.  Some of these conventions are traditional in the Unix
world and predate Linux; others have developed recently in response to
particular new tools and technologies such as the World Wide
Web.</P

into topic sections, each containing a series of checklist items.  Think of
these as a pre-flight checklist for your patch or software

>2. Good patching practice</H1
><P
>Most people get involved in open-source software by writing patches
for other peoples' software before releasing projects of their own.
Suppose you've written a set of source-code changes for someone else's
baseline code. Now put yourself in that person's shoes. How is he
to judge whether to include the patch?</P
><P
>The truth is that it is very difficult to judge the quality of code.
So developers tend to evaluate patches by the quality of the submission.
They look for clues in the submitter's style and communications behavior
instead &#8212; indications that the person has been in their shoes and
understands what it's like to have to evaluate and merge an incoming patch.
</P
><P
>This is actually a pretty reliable proxy for code quality.  In many
years of dealing with patches from many hundreds of strangers, I have only
seldom seen a patch that was thoughtfully presented and respectful of my
time but technically bogus.  On the other hand, experience teaches me that
patches which look careless or are packaged in a lazy and inconsiderate way
are very likely to actually <EM
>be</EM
> bogus.</P
><P
>Here are some tips on how to get your patch accepted:</P
><DIV
CLASS="sect2"
><HR><H2
CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="AEN102"
></A
>2.1. Do send patches, don't send whole archives or files</H2
><P
>If your change includes a new file that doesn't exist in the code,
then of course you have to send the whole file.  But if you're modifying
an already-existing file, don't send the whole file.  Send a diff instead;
specifically, send the output of the 
<SPAN
CLASS="citerefentry"
><SPAN
CLASS="refentrytitle"
>diff</SPAN
>(1)</SPAN
>
command run to compare the baseline distributed version against your
modified version.</P
><P
>The diff command and its dual, 
<SPAN
CLASS="citerefentry"
><SPAN
CLASS="refentrytitle"
>patch</SPAN
>(1)</SPAN
>
(which automatically applies a diff to a baseline file)
are the most basic tools of open-source development.  Diffs are better
than whole files because the developer you're sending a patch to may
have changed the baseline version since you got your copy.  By sending
him a diff you save him the effort of separating your changes from his;
you show respect for his time.</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="sect2"
><HR><H2
CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="AEN112"
></A
>2.2. Send patches against the current version of the code.</H2
><P
>It is both counterproductive and rude to send a maintainer
patches against the code as it existed several releases ago, and expect
him to do all the work of determining which changes duplicate things he
have since done, versus which things are actually novel in your patch.</P
><P
>As a patch submitter, it is <EM
>your</EM
> responsibility
to track the state of the source and send the maintainer a minimal patch
that expresses what you want done to the main-line codebase. That means
sending a patch against the current version.</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="sect2"
><HR><H2
CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="AEN117"
></A
>2.3. Don't include patches for generated files.</H2
><P
>Before you send your patch, walk through it and delete any
patch bands for files in it that are going to be automatically regenerated
once he applies the patch and remakes.  The classic examples of this
error are C files generated by <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Bison</SPAN
> 
or <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Flex</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>These days the most common mistake of this kind is sending a diff
with a huge band that is nothing but changebars between your
<B
CLASS="command"
>configure</B
> script and his.  This file is generated by
<B
CLASS="command"
>autoconf</B
>.</P
><P
>This is inconsiderate.  It means your recipient is put to the trouble
of separating the real content of the patch from a lot of bulky noise.
It's a minor error, not as important as some of the things we'll get
to further on &#8212; but it will count against you.</P

CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="AEN126"
></A
>2.4. Don't send patch bands that just tweak version-control $-symbols.</H2
><P
>Some people put special tokens in their source files that are
expanded by the version-control system when the file is checked in: the
<SPAN
CLASS="markup"
>$Id$</SPAN
> construct used by RCS, CVS, and
Subversion, for example.</P
><P
>If you're using a local version-control system yourself, your changes
may alter these tokens.  This isn't really harmful, because when your
recipient checks his code back in after applying your patch they'll get
re-expanded based on <EM
>his</EM
> version-control status.  But
those extra patch bands are noise.  They're distracting.  It's more
considerate not to send them.</P
><P
>This is another minor error.  You'll be forgiven for it if you
get the big things right.  But you want to avoid it anyway.</P

>2.5. Do use -c or -u format, don't use the default (-e) format</H2
><P
>The default (-e) format of
<SPAN
CLASS="citerefentry"
><SPAN
CLASS="refentrytitle"
>diff</SPAN
>(1)</SPAN
>
is very brittle.  It doesn't include any context, so the patch tool
can't cope if any lines have been inserted or deleted in the baseline 
code since you took the copy you modified.</P
><P
>Getting an -e diff is annoying, and suggests that the sender is
either an extreme newbie, careless, or clueless.  Most such patches
get tossed out without a second thought.</P
></DIV

CLASS="sect2"
><HR><H2
CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="AEN140"

>2.6. Do include documentation with your patch</H2
><P
>This is very important.  If your patch makes a user-visible addition
or change to the software's features, <EM
>include changes to the
appropriate man pages and other documentation files in your patch</EM
>.
Do <EM
>not</EM
> assume that the recipient will be happy to
document your code for you, or else to have undocumented features lurking
in the code.</P
><P
>Documenting your changes well demonstrates some good things.  First,
it's considerate to the person you are trying to persuade.  Second, it
shows that you understand the ramifications of your change well enough
to explain it to somebody who can't see the code.  Third, it demonstrates
that you care about the people who will ultimately use the software.</P
><P
>Good documentation is usually the most visible sign of what separates
a solid contribution from a quick and dirty hack.  If you take the time
and care necessary to produce it, you'll find you're already 85% of the
way to having your patch accepted with most developers.</P

CLASS="sect2"
><HR><H2
CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="AEN147"
></A
>2.7. Do include an explanation with your patch</H2
><P
>Your patch should include cover notes explaining why you think the
patch is necessary or useful.  This is explanation directed not to the
users of the software but to the maintainer to whom you are sending the
patch.</P
><P
>The note can be short &#8212; in fact, some of the most effective
cover notes I've ever seen just said "See the documentation updates in this
patch".  But it should show the right attitude.</P
><P
>The right attitude is helpful, respectful of the maintainer's time,
quietly confident but unassuming.  It's good to display understanding of
the code you're patching.  It's good to show that you can identify with the
maintainer's problems. It's also good to be up front about any risks you
perceive in applying the patch.  Here are some examples of the sorts of
explanatory comments that I like to see in cover notes:</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"
I've seen two problems with this code, X and Y.  I fixed problem X, but I
didn't try addressing problem Y because I don't think I understand
the part of the code that I believe is involved.
"</SPAN
></P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"
Fixed a core dump that can happen when one of the foo inputs is too long.
While I was at it, I went looking for similar overflows elsewhere.  I
found a possible one in blarg.c, near line 666.  Are you sure the sender
can't generate more than 80 characters per transmission?
"</SPAN
></P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"
Have you considered using the Foonly algorithm for this problem?  There
is a good implementation at &#60;http://www.somesite.com/~jsmith/foonly.html&#62;.
"</SPAN
></P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"
This patch solves the immediate problem, but I realize it complicates the
memory allocation in an unpleasant way.  Works for me, but you should 
probably test it under heavy load before shipping. 
"</SPAN
></P

This may be featurititis, but I'm sending it anyway.  Maybe you'll know a
cleaner way to implement the feature.

>2.8. Do include useful comments in your code</H2
><P
>Usually as a maintainer, I will want to have strong confidence that I
understand your changes before merging them in.  This isn't an invariable
rule; if you have a track record of good work, with me I may just run a
casual eyeball over the changes before checking them in semi-automatically.
But everything you can do to help me understand your code and decrease my
uncertainty increases your chances that I will accept your patch.</P

don't.</P

><P
>Don't gather various bugfixes, new features or other stuff and
send them as one single diff file. Instead, build a single diff for every
bugfix or feature. Every single diff should be generated using the current
version of the code and should not depend on any other patch you or someone
else sent before.</P
><P
>This helps the maintainer to read and understand your code, and he can
decide whether he wants to accept or abadon this single bugfix or feature.
For example, if you add a feature garanting full root access for everyone
because it's useful in your special setting, the maintainer will probably not
accept this part of your patch. When you send a single diff file confounding
this root access feature along with some bugfixes and other useful things, you
have a good chance the maintainer will ignore your complete patch.</P
><P
>With each bugfixes and new feature as a single diff file, the
maintainer could e.g. include your bugfixes in a few minutes and take later
a closer look to your new features or security issues.</P
><P
>Patches depending on other patches raise similar problems.  If the
maintainer rejects your basic patch, he won't be able to apply the
others. If you can't avoid such dependencies, offer to the maintainer that
you will bundle a patch with the sections or features he wants to
add.</P

><P
>Anything that is not public domain has a copyright, possibly more than
one.  Under the Berne Convention (which has been U.S. law since 1978),
the copyright does not have to be explicit.  That is, the authors of a
work hold copyright even if there is no copyright notice.</P
><P
> Who counts as an author can be very complicated, especially for
software that has been worked on by many hands.  This is why licenses
are important.  By setting out the terms under which material can be
used, they grant rights to the users that protect them from arbitrary
actions by the copyright holders.</P
><P
>In proprietary software, the license terms are designed to
protect the copyright.  They're a way of granting a few rights to
users while reserving as much legal territory is possible for the
owner (the copyright holder).  The copyright holder is very important,
and the license logic so restrictive that the exact technicalities of
the license terms are usually unimportant.</P
><P
>In open-source software, the situation is usually the exact opposite;
the copyright exists to protect the license.  The only rights the
copyright holder always keeps are to enforce the license.  Otherwise,
only a few rights are reserved and most choices pass to the user.  In
particular, the copyright holder cannot change the terms on a copy you
already have.  Therefore, in open-source software the copyright holder
is almost irrelevant &#8212; but the license terms are very important.</P
><P
>Normally the copyright holder of a project is the current
project leader or sponsoring organization.  Transfer of the project to
a new leader is often signaled by changing the copyright holder.
However, this is not a hard and fast rule; many open-source projects
have multiple copyright holders, and there is no instance on record of
this leading to legal problems.</P

know what they imply, and have a reasonable take on the risks and tradeoffs
they involve.  Therefore, use one of the standard licenses carried on the
OSI site if at all possible.</P

>If you must write your own license, be sure to have it certified
by OSI.  This will avoid a lot of argument and overhead.  Unless
you've been through it, you have no idea how nasty a licensing
flamewar can get; people become passionate because the licenses are
regarded as almost-sacred covenants touching the core values of the
open-source community.</P
><P
>Furthermore, the presence of an established interpretive tradition may
prove important if your license is ever tested in court.  At time of 
writing (early 2002) there is no case law either supporting or invalidating
any open-source license.  However, it is a legal doctrine (at least in
the U.S., and probably in other common-law countries such as England
and the rest of the British Commonwealth) that courts are supposed to 
interpret licenses and contracts according to the expectations and
practices of the community in which they originated.</P

mechanized querying of the licensing information. Fortunately, existing

live in a file named either COPYING or LICENSE in the top-level directory

>6.7. Recommended C/C++ portability practices</H2
><P
>If you are writing C, feel free to use the full ANSI features.
Specifically, do use function prototypes, which will help you spot
cross-module inconsistencies.  The old-style K&#38;R compilers are
history.</P
><P
>Do not assume compiler-specific features such as the GCC "-pipe"
option or nested functions are available. These will come around and
bite you the second somebody ports to a non-Linux, non-GCC system.</P
><P
>Code required for portability should be isolated to a single area
and a single set of source files (for example, an "os" subdirectory).
Compiler, library and operating system interfaces with portability
issues should be abstracted to files in this directory. This includes
variables such as "errno", library interfaces such as "malloc", and
operating system interfaces such as "mmap".</P
><P
>Portability layers make it easier to do new software ports. It is
often the case that no member of the development team knows the porting
platform (for example, there are literally hundreds of different
embedded operating systems, and nobody knows any significant fraction
of them). By creating a separate portability layer it is possible for
someone who knows the port platform to port your software without having
to understand it.</P
><P
>Portability layers simplify applications. Software rarely needs
the full functionality of more complex system calls such as mmap or
stat, and programmers commonly configure such complex interfaces
incorrectly. A portability layer with abstracted interfaces
("__file_exists" instead of a call to stat) allows you to export only
the limited, necessary functionality from the system, simplifying the
code in your application.</P
><P
>Always write your portability layer to select based on a feature,
never based on a platform. Trying to create a separate portability layer
for each supported platform results in a multiple update problem
maintenance nightmare. A "platform" is always selected on at least two
axes: the compiler and the library/operating system release. In some
cases there are three axes, as when Linux vendors select a C library
independently of the operating system release. With M vendors, N
compilers and O operating system releases, the number of "platforms"
quickly scales out of reach of any but the largest development teams.
By using language and systems standards such as ANSI and POSIX 1003.1,
the set of features is relatively constrained.</P
><P
>Portability choices can be made along either lines of code or
compiled files. It doesn't make a difference if you select alternate
lines of code on a platform, or one of a few different files. A rule of
thumb is to move portability code for different platforms into separate
files when the implementations diverged significantly (shared memory
mapping on UNIX vs. Windows), and leave portability code in a single
file when the differences are minimal (using gettimeofday,
clock_gettime, ftime or time to find out the current
time-of-day).</P
><P
>Avoid using complex types such as "off_t" and "size_t". They vary
in size from system to system, especially on 64-bit systems. Limit your
usage of "off_t" to the portability layer, and your usage of "size_t"
to mean only the length of a string in memory, and nothing else.</P
><P
>Never step on the namespace of any other part of the system,
(including file names, error return values and function names).  Where
the namespace is shared, document the portion of the namespace that you
use.</P
><P
>Choose a coding standard. The debate over the choice of standard
can go on forever &#8212; regardless, it is too difficult and expensive to
maintain software built using multiple coding standards, and so some
coding standard must be chosen. Enforce your coding standard ruthlessly,
as consistency and cleanliness of the code are of the highest priority;
the details of the coding standard itself are a distant second.</P

><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>Your documentation can be your design document.</EM
>
The best time to write it is before you type a single line of code,
while you're thinking out what you want to do.  You'll find that the
process of describing the way you want your program to work in natural
language focuses your mind on the high-level questions about  what it should
do and how it should work.  This may save you a lot of effort later.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>Your documentation is an advertisement for the 
quality of your code.</EM
>
Many people take poor, scanty, or illiterate documentation for a program as
a sign that the programmer is sloppy or careless of potential users' needs.
Good documentation, on the other hand, conveys a message of intelligence
and professionalism. If your program has to compete with other programs,
better make sure your documentation is at least as good as theirs lest
potential users write you off without a second look.

hosting powerful document-formatting tools, the plethora of different
formats has meant that documentation has tended to be fragmented and

>8.1. Documentation formats</H2
><P
>Here are the documentation markup formats now in widespread use among
open-source developers.  When we speak of "presentation" markup, we mean
markup that controls the document's appearance explicitly (such as a font
change).  When we speak of "structural" markup, we mean markup that
describes the logical structure of the document (like a section break or
emphasis tag.)  And when we speak of "indexing", we mean the process 
of extracting from a collection of documents a searchable collection
of topic pointers that users can employ to reliably find material
of interest across the entire collection.</P

command provides a pager and a stone-age search facility.  No support for
images or hyperlinks or indexing. Renders to Postscript for printing fairly
well.  Doesn't render to HTML at all well (essentially as flat text).
Tools are preinstalled on all Linux systems.</P
><P
>Man page format is not bad for command summaries or short reference
documents intended to jog the memory of an experienced user.  It starts to
creak under the strain for programs with complex interfaces and many
options, and collapses entirely if you need to maintain a set of documents
with rich cross-references (the markup has only weak and normally unused
support for hyperlinks).</P
></DD
><DT
>HTML</DT
><DD
><P
>Increasingly common since the Web exploded in 1993-1994. Markup is
partly structural, mostly presentation. Browseable through any web browser.
Good support for images and hyperlinks.  Limited built-in facilities for
indexing, but good indexing and search-engine technologies exist and are
widely deployed.  Renders to Postscript for printing pretty well.  HTML
tools are now universally available.</P
><P
>HTML is very flexible and suitable for many kinds of documentation.
Actually, it's <EM
>too</EM
> flexible; it shares with man page
format the problem that it's hard to index automatically because a lot of the 
markup describes presentation rather than document structure.</P
></DD
><DT
>Texinfo</DT
><DD
><P
>Texinfo is the documentation format used by the Free Software
Foundation. It's a set of macros on top of the powerful TeX formatting
engine. Mostly structural, partly presentation.  Browseable through Emacs
or a standalone <B
CLASS="command"
>info</B
> program.  Good support for
hyperlinks, none for images.  Good indexing for both print and on-line
forms; when you install a Texinfo document, a pointer to it is
automatically added to a browsable "dir" document listing all the Texinfo
documents on your system.  Renders to excellent Postscript and useable
HTML.  Texinfo tools are preinstalled on most Linux systems, and available
at the <A

><P
>Texinfo is a good design, quite usable for typesetting books as well

markup is part structural, part presentation, and the presentation part
creates problems for rendering. </P

>DocBook</DT

><P
>DocBook is a large, elaborate markup format based on SGML (more
recent versions on XML).  Unlike the other formats described here it is
entirely structural with no presentation markup.  Excellent support for

acceptably to Postscript for printing (quality is improving as the tools
evolve).  Tools and documentation are available at the <A
