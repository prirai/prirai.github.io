>&#13;    This document provides some guidelines that should help you
    run a successful installfest. 
    For purposes of this document, an installfest is a gathering at
    which experienced Linux users assist less experienced users with the
    installation and configuration of Linux distributions,
    and where Linux users can
    bring Linux systems to receive assistance with system problem
    remediation.
    </P
><P
>&#13;    Please take from this document whatever you want. It is meant to be
    a guide, not a recipe that must be followed exactly 
    to have a successful installfest.
    Any installfest where most of the people leave happy is a 
    successful event.

                to suddenly lose power because one person too many

>&#13;                How much power does a computer need?
                Laptops need about 0.5 amps.
                For a desktop/tower/workstation type of computer
                the amount of power needed depends on the monitor, 
                number of disk drives, etc.
                Basically though, if everything is connected to one
                power strip, then they need at most 3 to 4 amps at the moment
                that the power is turned on and 1.5 to 2 amps while
                they are running.

                You may want to include minimum system requirements

                not show up with an old machine, hoping to turn it
                into a power-house but leave disappointed.

            the loss of some or all of the data stored on that hard drive. That
            you are hereby advised that you should back up all important data

      0. PREAMBLE
    </H2
><P
>&#13;      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
      functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom:
      to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
      or without modifying it, either commercially or
      noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
      publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
      responsible for modifications made by others.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that
      derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
      sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
      license designed for free software.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
      software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
      should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
      does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
      for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
      published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
      works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

      1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    </H2
><P
>&#13;      This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
      contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
      world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
      under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below,
      refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
      and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy,
      modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
      copyright law.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing
      the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
      modifications and/or translated into another language.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter
      section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
      subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
      with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
      philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
      titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
      that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
      does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
      be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
      Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
      there are none.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
      listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
      that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
      be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
      general public, that is suitable for revising the document
      straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
      pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
      drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
      markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is
      not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is
      not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
      without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
      using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
      image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
      formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
      SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
      available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
      some word processors for output purposes only.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page
      itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
      material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
      formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page”
      means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s
      title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes
      copies of the Document to the public.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
      whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
      following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
      for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
      “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”,
      “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve
      the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that
      it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according to this
      definition.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
      states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.

      2. VERBATIM COPYING
    </H2
><P
>&#13;      You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
      notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
      Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
      measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
      copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
      exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
      must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
      may publicly display copies.

      3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    </H2
><P
>&#13;      If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
      printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
      Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
      back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
      the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
      these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
      you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
      actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
      than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
      along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
      access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
      Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
      latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
      distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
      copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
      through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
      Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
      them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

><P
>&#13;      You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
      conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
      Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
      filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
      modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
      addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

><P
>&#13;      A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
      independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
      distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
      resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
      the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
      not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.

      of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
      aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
      bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
      covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear

      8. TRANSLATION

><P
>&#13;      Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
      translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
      Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
      their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
      Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
      Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
      license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
      that you also include the original English version of this License and the
      original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a

    </H2
><P
>&#13;      The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
      Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
      similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
      address new problems or concerns. See

>&#13;      Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
      the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
      “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
      following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
      any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
      Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
      this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
      by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy
      can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
      proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
      authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
