>&#13;  This HOWTO describes how to use the Cryptoloop loop device encryption in the 2.6 Linux kernel series. Cryptoloop
  makes it possible to create encrypted file systems within a partition or another file in the file system. These encrypted files
  can the be moved to a CD, DVD, USB memory stick, etc. Cryptoloop makes
  use of the loop device. This device is a pseudo-device which serves as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loop"</SPAN
> through which each call to a the file system
  has to pass. This way, data can be processed in order to encrypt and decrypt it. Since kernel 2.6, the
  Crypto API has been integrated into the main kernel, and setting up an encrypted file system has become much easier. No
  additional kernel patches are required. An update of some userspace utilities is necessary. Unfortunately, the
  use of Cryptoloop is not very well-documented so far. This HOWTO is an attempt to make it easy everyone
  to create an encrypted file system using the standard Cryptoloop functionality.

  Cryptoloop is based on the Crypto API in the 2.6 Linux kernel. It should not be confused with Loop-AES, which is a completely
  separate project. Cryptoloop is similar to the Crypto API that was available as a separate patch for the 2.4 kernel series. The
  new version is not compatible with the older one.

>2. Introduction</H1
><P
>&#13;    There are currently a few alternatives to using Cryptoloop. Loop-AES (<A
HREF="http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net"
TARGET="_top"
>http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net</A
>)
    is probably the most well-known. It provides very similar functionality to Cryptoloop. Aes-loop
    is currently more mature than Cryptoloop and it is also faster (about twice as fast, according to the author of loop-AES), because it uses a highly 
    optimized assembler implementation for
    AES. This doesn't mean that Cryptoloop is slow. I have not noticed any significant speed differences between a Cryptoloop-encrypted
    partition and a non-encrypted partition during everyday work with normal amounts of I/O. Unless I/O performance is
    extremely important to you, Cryptoloop should do just fine. Loop-AES offers some additional features that are not yet present in the kernel
    implementation of Cryptoloop. Loop-AES requires modified userspace tools (mount, losetup) and these modifications are incompatible with
    Cryptoloop. You will not be able to use Cryptoloop and Loop-AES at the same time.
    </P
><P
>&#13;    In terms of security, Cryptoloop is doing ok. The key is usually generated from a password and its hash is used as the key to AES. This leads
    to the possibility of a <A
HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/67216/"
TARGET="_top"
>known-plaintext attack</A
>. 
    Loop-AES is superior in this regard, because it generates a random key and encrypts this
    key separately, making a known-plaintext attack more difficult. Loop-AES also supports a multi-key mode, where sectors are encrypted with
    64 separate AES keys. In general, a brute-force attack on your password can be very effective, if you choose a weak password. To be on
    the safe side, your password should be at least 20 characters long. Otherwise a brute-force attack on the password will be much easier
    than trying to brute-force the AES encryption directly.
    </P
><P
>&#13;    The Cryptoloop functionality in the standard kernel provides a stable and clean implementation without the need for extra patches. Since it
    is still fairly new, it may not have gotten the necessary amount of review in terms of security. You have to decide for yourself what
    is suitable for you.
    </P
><P
>&#13;    IMPORTANT: Cryptoloop has been marked deprecated in the latest 2.6 kernel. This means that it will no longer be maintained actively. The
    successor to Cryptoloop will be <A
HREF="http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/"
TARGET="_top"
>dm-crypt</A
>. Dm-crypt is available in the main kernel
    since 2.6.4. Cryptoloop will still be available in the main kernel for a long time, but dm-crypt will be the method of choice for disk
    encryption in the future. Dm-crypt is based on the device mapper and offers pretty much the same functionality as Cryptoloop. It is still
    very new and there are no easy-to-use userspace tools available yet. Dm-crypt is considered to be much cleaner code than Cryptoloop, but
    there are some important differences. For example, creating an ecrypted filesystem within a file will still require to go through a loop
    device, but this support is still in development. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;    There are other tools which allow you to create an encrypted file system. BestCrypt is a commercial product from Jetico. It allows you to
    create encrypted containers and has a large choice of ciphers. It also offers some nifty features such as hidden containers. It is available
    for Windows and Linux, which makes it suitable for interchanging encrypted containers between Windows and Linux. BestCrypt now compiles
    on 2.6 kernels as well. Cryptoloop can also create containers that can be moved around, by creating the encrypted file system
    within a file as described below. I don't know of a way to access the Cryptoloop-encrypted files from other operating systems such as Windows. In
    this case, BestCrypt may be your only choice.

>&#13;    There are other commercial disk encryption tools such as PGP disk, but to my knowledge there is no Linux support for them.

    Unfortunately there are many patches for util-linux out there. There are differences in the way how encrypted partitions are created

>Cryptoloop can be used either on a file or an entire file system. The following describes how to
set it up on a particular partition. This partition can be any partition you like; the following
example uses <TT

you like that has been enabled in the kernel. You can get a list of the algorithms supported by
your currently running kernel by looking into <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/proc/crypto</TT
>. An excellent resource, discussing the
different cryptographic algorithms, are Bruce Schneier's books, Applied Cryptography and Practical
Cryptography. Both AES and Serpent are probably a reasonable choice. AES has been cryptanalyzed a lot
and no serious weaknesses have been discovered so far. Serpent has not been analyzed as much, but is
considered to be even a little bit stronger than AES. However, Serpent is also slower than AES.
Stay away from DES, it is both slow and weak. Triple-DES may be an option, but AES is probably more
secure and faster, so there is really no reason to use Triple-DES anymore.

        There is one big downside to using Cryptoloop. Since the password is hashed to create the encryption key, it is not easy to change the password later on. 
        The most straight-forward way of changing the password is to create a new encrypted partition or file and move all data into it. For this reason, make 
        sure you select a strong password from the start.  AES may be a strong algorithm, but if you chose a weak password, that security goes down the drain.

         different way of passing the key size, and do not work with the 2.6 Crypto API.

>&#13;For all operations on the Cryptoloop device, it is important that the necessary modules are loaded. You
need to load at least the Cryptoloop module and the modules for each cipher with <B

are compiled directly into the kernel, this is not necessary.

>In order to mount the encrypted file system created above, you can use the standard mount command

>7. Using a file instead of a partition</H1
><P
>&#13;It is just as easy to create an encrypted file system within a file on another file system. This is especially useful
if you want to back up this file by burning it to a DVD, etc. You can then easily move the file around to other
machines as well.

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>&#13;If you want to change the size of the file, change the <TT
CLASS="varname"
>count</TT
> value accordingly. The above command creates 100000 blocks
of 1k in size, but you can change this to whatever you like. Just make sure it is not too small to hold the file system you
chose. You can choose any file name and path you want instead of <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/mystuff.aes</TT
> as long as there's enough space on the partition.
