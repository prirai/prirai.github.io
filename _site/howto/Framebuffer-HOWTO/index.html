>2. What is a framebuffer device?</H1
><P
>A framebuffer device is an abstraction for the graphic
			hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video
			hardware, and allows application software to access the
			graphic hardware through a well-defined interface, so
			that the software doesn't need to know anything about
			the low-level interface stuff [Taken from Geert
			Uytterhoeven's framebuffer.txt in the linux kernel
			sources]</P

>3. What advantages does framebuffer devices have?</H1
><P
>Penguin logo! :o) Seriously, the major advantage of the
			framebuffer devices is that it presents a generic
			interface across all platforms. It was the case until
			late in the 2.1.x kernel development process that the
			x86 platform had console drivers completely different
			from the other console drivers for other platforms.
			With the introduction of the 2.1.109 kernel, all this
			has changed for the better, and introduced more uniform
			handling of the console under the x86 platforms and
			also introduced true bitmapped graphical consoles
			bearing the Penguin logo on x86 for the first time, and
			allowed code to be shared across different platforms.
			Note that 2.0.x kernels do not support framebuffer
			devices, but it is possible someday someone will
			backport the code from the 2.1.x kernels to 2.0.x
			kernels.  There is an exception to that rule in that
			the 0.9.x kernel port for m68k platforms does have the
			framebuffer device support included.</P
><P
><EM
>With the release of the 2.2.x kernels,
				framebuffer device support is very solid and
				stable. You should use the framebuffer device
				if your graphic card supports it, if you are
				using 2.2.x kernels. Older 2.0.x kernels does
				not support framebuffer devices, at least on
				the x86 platform.</EM

>4.1. What is vesafb?</H2
><P
>Vesafb is a framebuffer driver for x86
				architecture that works with VESA 2.0 compliant
				graphic cards. It is closely related to the
				framebuffer device drivers in the
				kernel.</P
><P
>vesafb is a display driver that enables the use
				of graphical modes on your x86 platform for
				bitmapped text consoles. It can also display a
				logo, which is probably the main reason why
				you'd want to use vesafb :o)</P
><P
>Unfortunately, you can not use vesafb
				successfully with VESA 1.2 cards.  This is
				because these 1.2 cards do not use
				<EM
>linear</EM
> frame buffering.
				Linear frame buffering simply means that the
				system's CPU is able to access every bit of the
				display. Historically, older graphic adapters
				could allow the CPU to access only 64K at a
				time, hence the limitations of the dreadful
				CGA/EGA graphic modes! It may be that someone
				will write a vesafb12 device driver for these
				cards, but this will use up precious kernel
				memory and involve a nasty hack.</P
><P
>There is however a potential workaround to add
				VESA 2.0 extensions for your legacy VESA 1.2
				card. You may be able to download a TSR type
				program that will run from DOS, and used with
				loadlin, can help configure the card for the
				appropriate graphic console modes.  Note that
				this will not always work, as an example some
				Cirrus Logic cards such as the VLB 54xx series
				are mapped to a range of memory addresses (for
				example, within the 15MB-16MB range) for frame
				buffering which preludes these from being used
				successfully with systems that have more than
				32MB of memory. There is a way to make this
				work, i.e. if you have a BIOS option to leave a
				memory hole at 15MB-16MB range, it might work,
				Linux doesn't support the use of memory holes.
				However there are patches for this option
				though [Who has these and where do one gets
				them from?]. If you wish to experiment with
				this option, there are plenty of TSR style
				programs available, a prime example is UNIVBE,
				which can be found on the Internet.</P
><P
>Alternatively, you may be able to download kernel
				patches to allow your VESA 1.2 card to work
				with the VESA framebuffer driver. For example,
				there are patches for use with older S3 boards
				(such as S3 Trio, S3 Virge) that supports VESA
				1.2. For these cards, you can pick up patches
				from <A

>4.2. How do I activate the vesafb drivers?</H2
><P
>Assuming you are using menuconfig, you will need
				to do the following steps:</P
><P
>If your processor (on x86 platforms) supports
				MTRRs, enable this. It speeds up memory copies
				between the processor and the graphic card, but
				not strictly necessary. You can of course, do
				this after you have the console device
				working.</P
><P
><EM
>IMPORTANT: For 2.1.x kernels, go into
					the Code Maturity Level menu, and
					enable the prompt for development
					and / or incomplete drivers.  This is
					no longer necessary for the 2.2.x
					kernels.</EM
></P
><P
>Go into the Console Drivers menu, and enable the

><P
>VGA Chipset Support (text only) -
				vgafb - used to be part of the
				list above, but it has been removed as it is
				now deprecated and no longer supported. It will
				be removed shortly. Use VGA Text Console
				(fbcon) instead. VGA
				Character/Attributes is only used with VGA
				Chipset Support, and doesn't need to be
				selected.</P
><P
>Ensure that the Mac variable bpp packed pixel
				support is not enabled.  Linux kernel release
				2.1.111 (and 112) seemed to enable this
				automatically if Advanced Low Level Drivers was
				selected for the first time. This no longer
				happens with 2.1.113.</P
><P
>There is also the option to compile in fonts into
				memory, but this isn't really necessary, and
				you can always use kbd-0.99's (see
				section on fonts) setfont utility to change
				fonts by loading fonts into the console
				device.</P
><P
>Make sure these aren't going to be modules. [Not
				sure if it's possible to build them as modules
				yet - please correct me on this]</P
><P
>You'll need to create the framebuffer device in
				/dev. You need one per framebuffer
				device, so all you need to do is to type in
				mknod /dev/fb0 c 29 0 for the
				first one. Subsequent ones would be in
				multiples of 32, so for example to create
				/dev/fb1, you would need to type
				in mknod /dev/fb1 c 29 32, and so
				on up to the eighth framebuffer device
				(mknod /dev/fb7 c 29 224)</P
><P
>Then rebuild the kernel, modify
				/etc/lilo.conf to include the
				VGA=ASK parameter, and run
				lilo, this is required in order
				for you to be able to select the modes you wish
				to use.</P
><P
>Here's a sample LILO configuration (taken from my
				machine)</P
><P
><P
CLASS="literallayout"
>&#13;# LILO configuration file
boot = /dev/hda3
delay = 30
prompt
vga = ASK # Let user enter the desired modes
image = /vmlinuz
  root = /dev/hda3
  label = Linux
  read-only # Non-UMSDOS filesystems should be mounted read-only for checking
		  	</P
></P
><P
>Reboot the kernel, and as a simple test, try
				entering 0301 at the VGA prompt
				(this will give you 640x480 @ 256), and you
				should be able to see a cute little Penguin
				logo.</P
><P
>Note, that at the VGA prompt, you're required to
				type in the number in the format of "0" plus
				the three-digit number, and miss out the 'x'.
				This isn't necessary if you're using
				LILO.</P
><P
>Once you can see that's working well, you can
				explore the various VESA modes (see below) and
				decide on the one that you like the best, and
				hardwire that into the "VGA=x" parameter in
				lilo.conf. When you have chosen
				the one you like the best, look up the
				equivalent hexadecimal number from the table
				below and use that (i.e. for 1280x1024 @ 256,
				you just use "VGA=0x307"), and
				re-run lilo. That's all there it is to it.  For
				further references, read the LoadLin/LILO
				HOWTOs.</P
><P
><EM
>NOTE!</EM
> vesafb does not enable
				scrollback buffering as a default. You will
				need to pass to the kernel the option to enable
				it. Use video=vesa:ypan or
				video=vesa:ywrap to activate it.
				Both does the same thing, but in different
				ways. ywrap is a lot faster than
				ypan but may not work on slightly
				broken VESA 2.0 graphic cards.
				ypan is slower than
				ywrap but a lot more compatible.
				This option is only present in kernel 2.1.116
				and above.  Earlier kernels did not have the
				ability to allow scrollback buffering in
				vesafb.</P

				tricks:  you can make your cursor look like a
				non-blinking red block, make it inverse
				background of the character it's over or to
				highlight that character and still choose
				whether the original hardware cursor should
				remain visible or not. There may be other
				things I have never thought of.</P
><P
>The cursor appearance is controlled by a
				&#60;ESC&#62;[?1;2;3c escape
				sequence where 1, 2 and 3 are parameters
				described below. If you omit any of them, they
				will default to zeroes.</P
><P
>Parameter 1 specifies cursor size (0 = default, 1
				= invisible, 2 = underline, ..., 8 = full
				block) + 16 if you want the software cursor to
				be applied + 32 if you want to always change
				the background colour + 64 if you dislike
				having the background the same as the
				foreground.  Highlights are ignored for the
				last two flags.</P
><P
>The second parameter selects character attribute
				bits you want to change (by simply XORing them
				with the value of this parameter). On standard
				VGA, the high four bits specify background and
				the low four the foreground. In both groups,
				low three bits set colour (as in normal colour
				codes used by the console) and the most
				significant one turns on highlight (or
				sometimes blinking - it depends on the
				configuration of your VGA).</P
><P
>The third parameter consists of character
				attribute bits you want to set.  Bit setting
				takes place before bit toggling, so you can
				simply clear a bit by including it in both the
				set mask and the toggle mask.</P

						the documentation that comes
						with your external video
						hardware.</P
><P
>The next paramter
						(scrlen) tells the
						kernel about the size of the
						video memory. If it's missing,
						this is calculated from the
						(xres), and
						(depth)
						parameters. It's not useful to
						write a value here these days

>The (vgabase)
						parameter is optional. If it
						isn't given, the kernel can't
						read/write any colour registers
						of the video hardware, and thus
						you have to set up the
						appropriate colours before you
						boot Linux. But if your card is
						VGA compatible, you can give it
						the address where it can locate
						the VGA register set so it can
						change the colour lookup
						tables. This information can be
						found in your external video
						hardware documentation. To make
						this
						<EM
>clear</EM
>,
						(vgabase) is the
						base address, i.e
						a 4k aligned address. For
						reading/writing the colour
						registers, the kernel uses the
						address range between
						(vgabase) + 0x3c7 and
						(vgabase) + 0x3c9.
						This parameter is given in
						hexadecimal and must have a
						0x prefix, just
						like (scrmem).
						(colw) is only
						meaningful, if the
						(vgabase)
						parameter is specified. It
						tells the kernel how wide each
						of the colour register is, i.e
						the number of bits per single
						colour (red/green/blue).
						Default is usually 6 bits, but
						it is also common to specify 8
						bits.</P
><P
>(xres_virtual) is
						only required for the
						ProMST/ET4000 cards where the
						physical linelength differs
						from the visible length. With
						ProMST, you need to supply
						2048, whilst for ET4000, it
						depends on the initialisation
						of the video board.</P

>During make config, you need to choose whether to
				compile promcon and / or
				fbcon. You can select both, but if
				you do this, you will need to set the kernel
				flags to select the device. fbcon
				always takes precedence if not set. If
				promcon is not selected in, on
				boot up, it defaults to dummycon.
				If promcon is selected, it will
				use this device. Once the buses are booted, and
				fbcon is compiled in, the kernel
				probes for the above framebuffers and will use
				fbcon. If there is no framebuffer

>The first thing you'll need to do is to patch a
				copy of the Linux source with the
				"fbaddon" patch.  Then you need to
				configure the kernel and turn on frame buffer
				support.  If you have Matrox cards turn on
				Matrox unified accelerated driver support as
				well as the particular type of card you have.
				Don't turn on VESA frame buffer support. It can
				cause a conflict.  Do turn on multi-head
				support (obviously). Build the kernel and
				reboot.</P
><P
>Now you need to install the "fbset"
				program and carefully read all the
				documentation on how to adjust the settings.
				Using a "/etc/fb.modes" file is
				highly recommended once you've decided on your
				settings.  The fbset program includes a Perl
				script to convert your XF86Config file to
				fb.modes settings.  I've included my
				octave/Borne shell script to convert your
				XF86Config file in Appendix A &#38; B.</P
><P
>You need to get comfortable with using the frame
				buffer device on one monitor, understanding any
				issues that can arise from your set up that
				have nothing to do with multi-head support.
				This can save a lot of head scratching
				later.</P
