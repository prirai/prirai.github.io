   There are simply too many applications that do the same thing,
   that one cannot be expected to have used all of them. In a book
   on Scientific Computing using GNU/Linux, one would
   mention ones favorite tool to carry out a task and describe it in
   detail. However this is a howto providing links to various
   available free tools for scientific computing and may contain
   links to some software that promises much but delivers little

>&#13;  GNU/Linux is probably the platform of choice for scientific
  computing. There exists a wide variety of high level languages,
  debugging tools and other code development tools for
  programming, numerical subroutines for solving various types of
  equations, plotting and visualization packages, word processing
  software which can display equations and figures and in fact parallel
  programming software to construct a supercomputer with off the shelf
  PC parts and some hardware. This document aims to provide a list
  of <EM

  tasks and links to tutorials and other documents on how to setup and
  use these software applications.
 </P

>&#13;  This document does not aim to provide links to subject specific free
  software available for GNU/Linux systems. It aims to show how
  GNU/Linux can be used best to handle scientific computing tasks.
  It is hoped that people or institutions with interest in a
  specific subject list, compile a list of the free software available
  for that subject ... for example see <EM

>&#13;   Just installing GNU/Linux on your PC makes it a powerful workstation.
   The various popular distributions however do not have all the tools
   needed to make it the ideal scientific computing machine. This HOWTO
   aims to fill in this gap by creating a list of free software useful
   for scientific computing. It is assumed that people reading this
   document already have a PC with Linux and the GNU utilities installed.
   For those who do not have such a setup and want to install GNU-Linux
   can check out <A
HREF="./GNULinuxWS.html"

>GNU/Linux Systems</A

   for links to documents on installing GNU/Linux, and also on how to get
   started using GNU/Linux. Recently there has been an effort by Dirk
   Eddelbuettel to create a scientific computing environment

   which probably is the first GNU-Linux distribution tailored for
   Scientists. I checked out the latest release and it has almost
   all the packages mentioned in this document and many packages
   not mentioned. It is fair to say that if you have any linux distribution
   in which the packages are managed by rpms or any debian based system,
   you will find pre-compiled binaries of these packages and will not
   have to waste much time installing them.

     The GCC front end for FORTRAN 77. It is a very good FORTRAN77
     compiler. It however does not have the -r8 option which compiles
     a program as double precision. This could be a good compiler
     design philosophy but in many cases gives problems when porting
     a code from SUN / DEC / HP workstations onto Linux systems.

    I was happy to receive this link by mail. It was 3 years since I had
    migrated to using the GNU C compiler for scientific computing because
    there was no "truly free" FORTRAN-95 compiler available then. I thank

    fort77 is a perl program which invokes the f2c command
     (a Fortran to C translator) transparently, so it can
     be used just like a real Fortran compiler. Fort77 can
     be used to compile Fortran, C and assembler code and
     can link the code with f2c libraries. If you install
     fort77, you'll also need to install the f2c package.
     This does not have the "-r8" problem. You can download
     fort77 and f2c from the above link.

     scientific computing needs. Python is an interpreted,
     interactive, object-oriented programming language.

     It has a number of extensions for numerics, plotting,
     data storage and combined with Tk lets you develop very
     good GUIs for your codes. The most exciting aspect is that
     it simplifies programming because it has modules for almost
     anything (vectors, tensors, transformations, derivatives,
     linear algebra, Fourier transforms, statistics, etc ...) are
     available. You can also wrap C and Fortran libraries from
     Python. Finally if you want to write a numerical scheme of
     your own you may find that it is simpler in Python.
     There are also interfaces to netCDF (portable binary files),
     MPI and BSPlib (parallel programming).

>PLplot:</A
>
 This is a library of scientific plotting functions that can be called from
 C, C++, FORTRAN, TCL, PYTHON. PLplot features as described in the above link
 are, "It can be used to create standard x-y plots, semilog plots,
 log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.
 Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single
 page with multiple lines in each graph. There are almost 2000 characters
 in the extended character set. This includes four different fonts, the
 Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.
 A variety of output devices are supported and new devices can be easily
 added by writing a small number of device dependent routines". To download

     portable network graphics files with each presentation slide. With a

     Though the man page claims that it is a facility for the

     Other than generating figures for elucidating what you want to say in
     a poster, it helps you import and export figures in a variety of formats,
     write text in various fonts and sizes, generate Greek symbols and color
     text, Save as latex picture file or any other format supported by your
     word processor for inclusion in your publications, generate GIFs of each
     page of the poster to put on your web site, and finally it generates
     *.fig files which are small in size. The only thing on my wish list for
     xfig is the capability to edit the imported pictures which are not in
     *.fig format. Therefore for a computer screen projected poster
     presentation you need a frames capable browser with contents in one frame
     and the xfig generated posters (exported as *.png or *.jpg from Xfig) on
     the other.
