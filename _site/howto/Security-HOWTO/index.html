>2.1. Why Do We Need Security?</H2
><P
>&#13;In the ever-changing world of global data communications, inexpensive
Internet connections, and fast-paced software development, security is
becoming more and more of an issue.  Security is now a basic
requirement because global computing is inherently insecure.  As your
data goes from point A to point B on the Internet, for example, it may
pass through several other points along the way, giving other users
the opportunity to intercept, and even alter, it.  Even other
users on your system may maliciously transform your data into
something you did not intend.  Unauthorized access to your system may
be obtained by intruders, also known as "crackers", who then use
advanced knowledge to impersonate you, steal information from you, or
even deny you access to your own resources.  If you're wondering
what the difference is between a "Hacker" and a "Cracker", see Eric
Raymond's document, "How to Become A Hacker", available at <A
HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</A
>.
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="sect2"
><HR><H2
CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="AEN89"
></A
>2.2. How Secure Is Secure?</H2
><P
>&#13;First, keep in mind that no computer system can ever be completely
secure. All you can do is make it increasingly difficult for someone
to compromise your system. For the average home Linux user, not much
is required to keep the casual cracker at bay. However, for
high-profile Linux users (banks, telecommunications companies, etc),
much more work is required.
</P
><P
>&#13;Another factor to take into account is that the more secure your
system is, the more intrusive your security becomes. You need to
decide where in this balancing act your system will still be usable,
and yet secure for your purposes. For instance, you could require
everyone dialing into your system to use a call-back modem to call
them back at their home number. This is more secure, but if someone is
not at home, it makes it difficult for them to login. You could also
setup your Linux system with no network or connection to the Internet,
but this limits its usefulness.
</P
><P
>&#13;If you are a medium to large-sized site, you should establish a
security policy stating how much security is required by your site
and what auditing is in place to check it. You can find a well-known
security policy example at <A
HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2196.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2196.html</A
>.  It has been recently
updated, and contains a great framework for establishing a security
policy for your company.

>2.3. What Are You Trying to Protect?</H2
><P
>&#13;Before you attempt to secure your system, you should determine what
level of threat you have to protect against, what risks you should or
should not take, and how vulnerable your system is as a result.  You
should analyze your system to know what you're protecting,
why you're protecting it, what value it has, and who has
responsibility for your data and other assets.
</P
><P
>&#13;
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>Risk</EM
> is the possibility that an intruder may be successful in
attempting to access your computer.  Can an intruder read or write
files, or execute programs that could cause damage?  Can they delete
critical data? Can they prevent you or your company from getting important work 
done? Don't forget: someone gaining access to your account, or your
system, can also impersonate you.
</P
><P
>&#13;Additionally, having one insecure account on your system can result in 
your entire network being compromised.  If you allow a single user
to login using a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.rhosts</TT
> file, or to use an insecure
service such as <TT
CLASS="literal"
>tftp</TT
>, you risk an intruder getting 'his
foot in the door'.  Once the intruder has a user account on your
system, or someone else's system, it can be used to gain access to
another system, or another account.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>Threat</EM
> is typically from someone with motivation to gain unauthorized
access to your network or computer.  You must decide whom you trust to 
have access to your system, and what threat they could pose.
</P
><P
>&#13;There are several types of intruders, and it is useful to keep their
different characteristics in mind as you are securing your systems.
</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>The Curious</EM
> - This type of intruder is basically
interested in finding out what type of system and data you have.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>The Malicious</EM
> - This type of intruder is out to either
bring down your systems, or deface your web page, or otherwise force you
to spend time and money recovering from the damage he has caused. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>The High-Profile Intruder</EM
> - This type of intruder is
trying to use your system to gain popularity and infamy.  He might use 
your high-profile system to advertise his abilities.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>The Competition</EM
> - This type of intruder is interested in
what data you have on your system.  It might be someone who thinks you 
have something that could benefit him, financially or otherwise.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>The Borrowers</EM
> - This type of intruder is interested in
setting up shop on your system and using its resources for their own
purposes. He typically will run chat or irc servers, porn archive
sites, or even DNS servers. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>The Leapfrogger</EM
> - This type of intruder is only
interested in your system to use it to get into other systems. If your 
system is well-connected or a gateway to a number of internal hosts,
you may well see this type trying to compromise your system.
</P
></LI
></UL
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Vulnerability describes how well-protected your computer is from
another network, and the potential for someone to gain unauthorized
access.
</P
><P
>&#13;What's at stake if someone breaks into your system?  Of course the
concerns of a dynamic PPP home user will be different from those of a
company connecting their machine to the Internet, or another large
network.
</P
><P
>&#13;How much time would it take to retrieve/recreate any data that was
lost?  An initial time investment now can save ten times more time
later if you have to recreate data that was lost.  Have you checked
your backup strategy, and verified your data lately?

>2.4. Developing A Security Policy</H2
><P
>&#13;Create a simple, generic policy for your system that your users can
readily understand and follow.  It should protect the data you're
safeguarding as well as the privacy of the users.  Some things to
consider adding are: who has access to the system (Can my friend use my
account?), who's allowed to install software on the system, who owns
what data, disaster recovery, and appropriate use of the system.
</P
><P
>&#13;A generally-accepted security policy starts with the phrase
</P
><P
>&#13;<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<EM
>		That which is not permitted is prohibited</EM
>"</SPAN
>
</P
><P
>&#13;This means that unless you grant access to a service for a user, that
user shouldn't be using that service until you do grant access. Make
sure the policies work on your regular user account. Saying, "Ah, I
can't figure out this permissions problem, I'll just do it as root"
can lead to security holes that are very obvious, and even ones that
haven't been exploited yet.

>2.5. Means of Securing Your Site</H2
><P
>&#13;This document will discuss various means with which you can secure
the assets you have worked hard for: your local machine,
your data, your users, your network, even your reputation.  What would 
happen to your reputation if an intruder deleted some of your users'
data?  Or defaced your web site?  Or published your company's
corporate project plan for next quarter?  If you are planning a network 
installation, there are many factors you must take into account before
adding a single machine to your network.
</P
><P
>&#13;Even if you have a single dial up PPP account, or just a small site,
this does not mean intruders won't be interested in your systems.
Large, high-profile sites are not the only targets -- many intruders
simply want to exploit as many sites as possible, regardless of their
size. Additionally, they may use a security hole in your site to gain
access to other sites you're connected to.
</P
><P
>&#13;Intruders have a lot of time on their hands, and can avoid guessing
how you've obscured your system just by trying all the
possibilities.  There are also a number of reasons an intruder may be
interested in your systems, which we will discuss later.

>2.5.1. Host Security</H3
><P
>&#13;Perhaps the area of security on which administrators concentrate most is
host-based security.  This typically involves making sure your own
system is secure, and hoping everyone else on your network does the
same.  Choosing good passwords, securing your host's local network
services, keeping good accounting records, and upgrading programs with
known security exploits are among the things the local security
administrator is responsible for doing.  Although this is absolutely
necessary, it can become a daunting task once your network becomes
larger than a few machines.

>2.5.2. Local Network Security</H3
><P
>&#13;Network security is as necessary as local host security.  With
hundreds, thousands, or more computers on the same network,
you can't rely on each one of those systems being secure.  Ensuring
that only authorized users can use your network,
building firewalls, using strong encryption, and ensuring
there are no "rogue" (that is, unsecured) machines on your network are all
part of the network security administrator's duties.

>2.5.3. Security Through Obscurity</H3
><P
>&#13;One type of security that must be discussed is "security through
obscurity". This means, for example, moving a service that has known
security vulnerabilities to a non-standard port in hopes that attackers 
won't notice it's there and thus won't exploit it. Rest assured that
they can determine that it's there and will exploit it. Security
through obscurity is no security at all. Simply because you may have a
small site, or a relatively low profile, does not mean an intruder
won't be interested in what you have.  We'll discuss what you're
protecting in the next sections.

>3. Physical Security</H1
><P
>&#13;The first layer of security you need to take into account is the
physical security of your computer systems. Who has direct physical
access to your machine? Should they? Can you protect your machine from
their tampering? Should you? 
</P
><P
>&#13;How much physical security you need on your system is very dependent
on your situation, and/or budget. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If you are a home user, you probably don't need a lot (although you
might need to protect your machine from tampering by children or
annoying relatives).  If you are in a lab, you need
considerably more, but users will still need to be able to get work
done on the machines. Many of the following sections will help out. If
you are in an office, you may or may not need to secure your machine
off-hours or while you are away. At some companies, leaving your
console unsecured is a termination offense.

locked cabinets, and video surveillance are all good ideas, but beyond

>3.1. Computer locks</H2
><P
>&#13;Many modern PC cases include a "locking" feature. Usually this
will be a socket on the front of the case that allows you to turn an
included key to a locked or unlocked position. Case locks can help
prevent someone from stealing your PC, or opening up the case and
directly manipulating/stealing your hardware. They can also sometimes
prevent someone from rebooting your computer from their own floppy or
other hardware. 
</P
><P
>&#13;These case locks do different things according to the support in the
motherboard and how the case is constructed. On many PC's they make it
so you have to break the case to get the case open. On some others,
they will not let you plug in new keyboards or
mice. Check your motherboard or case instructions for more
information. This can sometimes be a very useful feature, even though
the locks are usually very low-quality and can easily be defeated by
attackers with locksmithing. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Some machines (most notably SPARC's and macs) have a dongle on the back
that, if you put a cable through, attackers would have to cut the cable
or break the case to get into it. Just putting a padlock or combo lock
through these can be a good deterrent to someone stealing your
machine.

>3.2. BIOS Security</H2
><P
>&#13;The BIOS is the lowest level of software that configures or
manipulates your x86-based hardware. LILO and other Linux boot methods
access the BIOS to determine how to boot up your Linux machine. Other
hardware that Linux runs on has similar software (Open Firmware on Macs
and new Suns, Sun boot PROM, etc...). You can use your BIOS to prevent 
attackers from rebooting your machine and manipulating your Linux
system. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Many PC BIOSs let you set a boot password. This
doesn't provide all that much security (the BIOS can be reset, or removed
if someone can get into the case), but might be a good deterrent (i.e. it
will take time and leave traces of tampering). Similarly, on
S/Linux (Linux for SPARC(tm) processor machines), your EEPROM
can be set to require a boot-up password. This might slow attackers down.  
</P
><P
>&#13;Another risk of trusting BIOS passwords to secure your system is the
default password problem. Most BIOS makers don't expect people to
open up their computer and disconnect batteries if they forget their
password and have equipped their BIOSes with default passwords that
work regardless of your chosen password. Some of the more common
passwords include:
</P
><P
>&#13;j262
AWARD_SW
AWARD_PW

AMI!SW1

easily available from manufacturers' websites and
<A
HREF="http://astalavista.box.sk"
TARGET="_top"
>http://astalavista.box.sk</A
> 
and as such a BIOS password cannot be considered adequate protection
from a knowledgeable attacker. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Many x86 BIOSs also allow you to specify various other good security
settings. Check your BIOS manual or look at it the next time you boot
up. For example, some BIOSs disallow booting from floppy drives and some
require passwords to access some BIOS features. 
</P
><P
>&#13;<EM
>Note</EM
>: If you have a server machine, and you set up a boot password,
your machine will not boot up unattended. Keep in mind that you will
need to come in and supply the password in the event of a power
failure. ;(

</P
><P
>&#13;Keep in mind when setting all these passwords that you need to
remember them. :) Also remember that these passwords will merely slow
the determined attacker.  They won't prevent someone from booting from 
a floppy, and mounting your root partition.  If you are using security 
in conjunction with a boot loader, you might as well disable booting
from a floppy in your computer's BIOS, and password-protect the BIOS.
</P
><P
>&#13;Also keep in mind that the /etc/lilo.conf will need to be mode "600"
(readable and writing for root only), or others will be able to read
your passwords!
</P
><P
>&#13;&#62;From the GRUB info page:  
GRUB provides "password" feature, so that only administrators
    can start the interactive operations (i.e. editing menu entries and
    entering the command-line interface). To use this feature, you need to
    run the command `password' in your configuration file (*note
    password::), like this:
</P
><P
>&#13;	 password --md5 PASSWORD
</P
><P
>&#13;       If this is specified, GRUB disallows any interactive control, until
    you press the key &#60;p&#62; and enter a correct password.  The option `--md5'
    tells GRUB that `PASSWORD' is in MD5 format.  If it is omitted, GRUB
    assumes the `PASSWORD' is in clear text.
</P
><P
>&#13;       You can encrypt your password with the command `md5crypt' (*note
    md5crypt::). For example, run the grub shell (*note Invoking the grub
    shell::), and enter your password:
</P
><P
>&#13;	 grub&#62; md5crypt
	 Password: **********
	 Encrypted: $1$U$JK7xFegdxWH6VuppCUSIb.
</P
><P
>&#13;       Then, cut and paste the encrypted password to your configuration
    file.
</P
><P
>&#13;Grub also has a 'lock' command that will allow you to lock a partition
if you don't provide the correct password. Simply add 'lock' and the
partition will not be accessable until the user supplies a password.

>3.4. xlock and vlock</H2
><P
>&#13;If you wander away from your machine from time to time, it is nice to
be able to "lock" your console so that no one can tamper with, or look at,
your work. Two programs that do this are: <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xlock</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>vlock</TT

</P
><P
>&#13;<TT
CLASS="literal"
>xlock</TT

distributions that support X. Check out the man page for it for more
options, but in general you can run <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xlock</TT
> from any xterm on your
console and it will lock the display and require your password to
unlock. 
</P
><P
>&#13;<TT
CLASS="literal"
>vlock</TT
> is a simple little program that allows you to lock some or all
of the virtual consoles on your Linux box. You can lock just the one
you are working in or all of them. If you just lock one, others can
come in and use the console; they will just not be able to use your
virtual console until you unlock it. <TT
CLASS="literal"
>vlock</TT
> ships with RedHat
Linux, but your mileage may vary. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Of course locking your console will prevent someone from tampering
with your work, but won't prevent them from rebooting your machine
or otherwise disrupting your work. It also does not prevent them from
accessing your machine from another machine on the network and causing 
problems.
</P
><P
>&#13;More importantly, it does not prevent someone from switching out of
the X Window System entirely, and going to a normal virtual console
login prompt, or to the VC that X11 was started from, and suspending
it, thus obtaining your privileges.  For this reason, you might
consider only using it while under control of xdm.

>3.6. Detecting Physical Security Compromises</H2
><P
>&#13;The first thing to always note is when your machine was
rebooted. Since Linux is a robust and stable OS, the only times your
machine should reboot is when <EM
>you</EM
> take it down for OS upgrades,
hardware swapping, or the like. If your machine has rebooted without
you doing it, that may be a sign that an intruder has compromised
it. Many of the ways that your machine can be compromised require the
intruder to reboot or power off your machine. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Check for signs of tampering on the case and computer area. Although
many intruders clean traces of their presence out of logs, it's a good
idea to check through them all and note any discrepancy.
</P
><P
>&#13;It is also a good idea to store log data at a secure location, such as 
a dedicated log server within your well-protected network.  Once a
machine has been compromised, log data becomes of little use as it
most likely has also been modified by the intruder.
</P
><P
>&#13;The syslog daemon can be configured to automatically send log data to
a central syslog server, but this is typically sent unencrypted, 
allowing an intruder to view data as it is being transferred.  This
may reveal information about your network that is not intended to be
public.  There are syslog daemons available that encrypt the data as
it is being sent. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Also be aware that faking syslog messages is easy -- with an exploit
program having been published.  Syslog even accepts net log entries
claiming to come from the local host without indicating their true origin.

intruders attempt while on their way to exploiting the root

local services. If you make sure your local security is tight, then
the intruder will have another hurdle to jump.

>4.2. Root Security</H2
><P
>&#13;The most sought-after account on your machine is the root (superuser)
account.  This account has authority over the entire machine, which
may also include authority over other machines on the network.
Remember that you should only use the root account for very short,
specific tasks, and should mostly run as a normal user. Even small
mistakes made while logged in as the root user can cause problems. The 
less time you are on with root privileges, the safer you will be. 
</P

>&#13;Several tricks to avoid messing up your own box as root:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;When doing some complex command, try running it first in a
non-destructive way...especially commands that use globing: e.g., if
you want to do <TT
CLASS="literal"
>rm foo*.bak</TT
>, first do <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ls foo*.bak</TT
> and make
sure you are going to delete the files you think you are. Using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>echo</TT
>
in place of destructive commands also sometimes works. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Provide your users with a default alias to the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>rm</TT
> command to ask for
confirmation for deletion of files.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; 
Only become root to do single specific tasks. If you find yourself
trying to figure out how to do something, go back to a normal user
shell until you are <EM
>sure</EM
> what needs to be done by root. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;The command path for the root user is very important.  The command
path (that is, the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>PATH</TT
> environment variable) specifies the
directories in which the shell searches for programs.  Try to limit
the command path for the root user as much as possible, and <EM
>never</EM
>
include <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.</TT
> (which means "the current directory") in your PATH.
Additionally, never have writable directories in your search path, as
this can allow attackers to modify or place new binaries in your
search path, allowing them to run as root the next time you run that
command.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Never use the rlogin/rsh/rexec suite of tools (called the r-utilities)
as root. They are subject to many sorts of attacks, and are downright

adding new users.  Any program that offers a shell escape will give
root access to a user invoking it via <TT

most editors, for example.  Also, a program as innocuous as
<TT

>5.4. Trojan Horses</H2
><P
>&#13;"Trojan Horses" are named after the fabled ploy in Virgil's  "Aenid".
The idea is that a cracker distributes a program or binary that sounds
great, and encourages other people to download it and run it as root. Then
the program can compromise their system while they are not paying
attention. While they think the binary they just pulled down does one
thing (and it might very well), it also compromises their security. 
</P
><P
>&#13;You should take care of what programs you install on your
machine. RedHat provides MD5 checksums and PGP signatures on its RPM 
files so you can verify you are installing the real thing. Other 
distributions have similar methods. You should never run any unfamiliar 
binary, for which you don't have the source, as root. Few attackers are 
willing to release source code to public scrutiny.
</P
><P
>&#13;Although it can be complex, make sure you are getting the source for
a program from its real distribution site. If the program is going to
run as root, make sure either you or someone you trust has looked over
the source and verified it.

>6. Password Security and Encryption</H1
><P
>&#13;One of the most important security features used today are
passwords. It is important for both you and all your users to have
secure, unguessable passwords. Most of the more recent Linux
distributions include <TT
CLASS="literal"
>passwd</TT
> programs that do not allow you to set a
easily guessable password. Make sure your <TT
CLASS="literal"
>passwd</TT
> program is up to date
and has these features.
</P
><P
>&#13;In-depth discussion of encryption is beyond the scope of this
document, but an introduction is in order. Encryption is very useful,
possibly even necessary in this day and age. There are all sorts of
methods of encrypting data, each with its own set of
characteristics.
</P
><P
>&#13;Most Unicies (and Linux is no exception) primarily use a one-way
encryption algorithm, called DES (Data Encryption Standard) to encrypt
your passwords. This encrypted password is then stored in (typically)
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> (or less commonly) <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
>. When you attempt to login,
the password you type in is encrypted again and compared with the entry in
the file that stores your passwords. If they match, it must be the
same password, and you are allowed access. Although DES is a two-way
encryption algorithm (you can code and then decode a message, given
the right keys), the variant that most Unixes use is one-way. This
means that it should not be possible to reverse the encryption to get
the password from the contents of <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> (or <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
>).
</P
><P
>&#13;Brute force attacks, such as "Crack" or "John the Ripper" (see section <A
HREF="#crack"
>Section 6.9</A
>) can often guess passwords unless your password is sufficiently
random. PAM modules (see below) allow you to use a different
encryption routine with your passwords (MD5 or the like).  You can use
Crack to your advantage, as well.  Consider periodically running Crack
against your own password database, to find insecure passwords.  Then
contact the offending user, and instruct him to change his password.

>6.1. PGP and Public-Key Cryptography</H2
><P
>&#13;Public-key cryptography, such as that used for PGP,
uses one key for encryption, and one key for
decryption.  Traditional cryptography, however, uses the same key
for encryption and decryption; this key must
be known to both parties, and thus somehow transferred from one to the other
securely.
</P
><P
>&#13;To alleviate the need to securely transmit the encryption
key, public-key encryption uses two separate keys: a public key
and a private key.  Each person's public key is available by anyone to
do the encryption, while at the same time each person keeps his or her
private key to decrypt messages encrypted with the correct public key.
</P
><P

and you can read about those differences in <A

method developed by Netscape to provide security over the Internet.
It supports several different encryption protocols, and provides
client and server authentication.  SSL operates at the transport
layer, creates a secure encrypted channel of data, and thus can
seamlessly encrypt data of many types.  This is most commonly seen
when going to a secure site to view a secure online document with
Communicator, and serves as the basis for secure communications with
Communicator, as well as many other Netscape Communications data
encryption.  More information can be found at <A

some issues (such as key management) are still not fully resolved.
CIPE uses a simpler approach, in which many things which can be

>&#13;Shadow passwords are a means of keeping your encrypted password
information secret from normal users. Recent versions of both Red Hat

systems, encrypted passwords

password-guesser programs on them and attempt to determine what they are.
Shadow passwords, by contrast, are saved in <TT

only privileged users can read. In order to use shadow passwords, you
need to make sure all your utilities that need access to password
information are recompiled to support them. PAM (above) also allows you

from one host to another, it does not always get sent as a single
packet of data, but rather it is fragmented into several pieces.  The
problem with this is that the port numbers are only stored in the
first fragment.  This means that someone can insert information into
the remaining packets that isn't supposed to be there.

should be accessible from the outside world. An external client
sends a request to port 80 of the firewall, the firewall forwards
this request to the web server, the web server handles the request
and the results are sent through the firewall to the original
client. The client thinks that the firewall machine itself is
running the web server. This can also be used for load balancing if
you have a farm of identical web servers behind the firewall.

>8.1. Packet Sniffers</H2
><P
>&#13;One of the most common ways intruders gain access to more systems on
your network is by employing a packet sniffer on a already compromised 
host. This "sniffer" just listens on the Ethernet port for things like 
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>passwd</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>login</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>su</TT
> in the packet stream 
and then logs the traffic after that. This way, attackers gain passwords
for systems they are not even attempting to break into. Clear-text
passwords are very vulnerable to this attack. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Example: Host A has been compromised. Attacker installs a
sniffer. Sniffer picks up admin logging into Host B from Host C. It
gets the admins personal password as they login to B. Then, the admin
does a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>su</TT
> to fix a problem. They now have the root password for Host 
B. Later the admin lets someone <TT
CLASS="literal"
>telnet</TT
> from his account to Host Z on
another site. Now the attacker has a password/login on Host Z. 
</P
><P
>&#13;In this day and age, the attacker doesn't even need to compromise a
system to do this: they could also bring a laptop or pc into a
building and tap into your net. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ssh</TT
> or other encrypted password methods thwarts this
attack. Things like APOP for POP accounts also prevents this
attack. (Normal POP logins are very vulnerable to this, as is anything

>&#13;Denial of service attacks have increased greatly in recent years. Some
of the more popular and recent ones are listed below. Note that new

>&#13;<EM
>SYN Flooding</EM
> - SYN flooding is a network
denial of service attack. It takes advantage of a "loophole" in the
way TCP connections are created. The newer Linux kernels (2.0.30 and
up) have several configurable options to prevent SYN flood attacks
from denying people access to your machine or services. See <A
HREF="#kernel-security"

protection options.

>&#13;<EM
>Pentium "F00F" Bug</EM
> - It was recently discovered that a series of
assembly codes sent to a genuine Intel Pentium processor would reboot
the machine.  This affects every machine with a Pentium processor (not
clones, not Pentium Pro or PII), no matter what operating system it's
running. Linux kernels 2.0.32 and up contain a work around for this
bug, preventing it from locking your machine. Kernel 2.0.33 has an
improved version of the kernel fix, and is suggested over 2.0.32.  If
you are running on a Pentium, you should upgrade now!
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>Ping Flooding</EM
> - Ping flooding is a simple brute-force denial
of service attack. The attacker sends a "flood" of ICMP packets to
your machine. If they are doing this from a host with better bandwidth
than yours, your machine will be unable to send anything on the
network. A variation on this attack, called "smurfing", sends ICMP
packets to a host with <EM
>your</EM
> machine's return IP, allowing them to
flood you less detectably.  You can find more information about the
"smurf" attack at <A

><P
>&#13;If you are ever under a ping flood attack, use a tool like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>tcpdump</TT

determine where the packets are coming from (or appear to be coming
from), then contact your provider with this information. Ping floods
can most easily be stopped at the router level or by using a firewall.

><P
>&#13;<EM
>Ping o' Death</EM
> - The Ping o' Death attack sends
ICMP ECHO REQUEST packets that are too large to fit in the kernel data
structures intended to store them.  Because sending a
single, large (65,510 bytes) "ping" packet to many systems will cause
them to hang or even crash, this problem was quickly dubbed the "Ping
o' Death."  This one has long been fixed, and is no longer anything to 
worry about.

>&#13;<EM
>Teardrop / New Tear</EM

involves a bug present in the IP fragmentation code on Linux and
Windows platforms.  It is fixed in kernel version 2.0.33, and does not 
require selecting any kernel compile-time options to utilize the fix.
Linux is apparently not vulnerable to the "newtear" exploit.

change their password once and have it take effect on all the machines

>&#13;NIS is not at all secure. It was never meant to be. It was meant to be
handy and useful. Anyone that can guess the name of your NIS domain

possible to spoof NIS and do all sorts of nasty tricks. If you must

provides the ability to track and control the flow of communication passing
through the filter. The ability to keep track of state and context information
about a session makes rules simpler and tries to interpret higher-level protocols.
</P

>&#13;Additionally, small modules can be developed to perform additional specific
functions, such as passing packets to programs in userspace for processing
then reinjecting back into the normal packet flow. The ability to develop these
programs in userspace reduces the level of complexity that was previously
associated with having to make changes directly at the kernel level.

>&#13;Ok, so you have checked over your system, and determined it's as secure

you should now do in order to prepare for an intrusion,
so you can quickly disable the intruder, and get
back up and running.

><P
>&#13;Discussion of backup methods and storage is beyond the scope of this
document, but here are a few words relating to backups and security: 
</P
><P
>&#13;If you have less than 650mb of data to store on a partition, a CD-R
copy of your data is a good way to go (as it's hard to tamper with
later, and if stored properly can last a long time), you will of
course need at least 650MB of space to make the image. Tapes and other
re-writable media should be write-protected as soon as your backup is
complete, and then verified to prevent tampering. Make sure you store your
backups in a secure off-line area. A good backup will ensure that you
have a known good point to restore your system from.

>9.2. Choosing a Good Backup Schedule</H2
><P
>&#13;A six-tape cycle is easy to maintain.  This includes four tapes
for during the week, one tape for even Fridays, and one tape for odd
Fridays.  Perform an incremental backup every day, and a full backup
on the appropriate Friday tape. If you make some particularly important
changes or add some important data to your system, a full backup might
well be in order.

>9.4. Backup Your RPM or Debian File Database</H2
><P
>&#13;In the event of an intrusion, you can use your RPM database like you
would use <TT
CLASS="literal"
>tripwire</TT
>, but only if you can be sure it too hasn't been
modified.  You should copy the RPM database to a floppy, and keep this
copy off-line at all times. The Debian distribution likely has
something similar.
</P
><P
>&#13;The files <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/var/lib/rpm/fileindex.rpm</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/var/lib/rpm/packages.rpm</TT
> most likely won't fit on a single floppy.
But if compressed, each should fit on a seperate floppy.
</P
><P
>&#13;Now, when your system is compromised, you can use the command:
</P

to verify each file on the system.  See the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>rpm</TT
> man page, as there are
a few other options that can be included to make it less verbose.
Keep in mind you must also be sure your RPM binary has not been
compromised.
</P
><P
>&#13;This means that every time a new RPM is added to the system, the RPM
database will need to be rearchived.  You will have to decide the
advantages versus drawbacks.

>9.5. Keep Track of Your System Accounting Data</H2
><P
>&#13;It is very important that the information that comes from <TT
CLASS="literal"
>syslog</TT
>
not be compromised.  Making the files in <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/var/log</TT
> readable and
writable by only a limited number of users is a good start. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Be sure to keep an eye on what gets written there, especially under
the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>auth</TT
> facility.  Multiple login failures, for example, can
indicate an attempted break-in.
</P
><P
>&#13;Where to look for your log file will depend on your distribution. In a
Linux system that conforms to the "Linux Filesystem Standard", such as
Red Hat, you will want to look in <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/var/log</TT
> and check <TT
CLASS="literal"
>messages</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>mail.log</TT
>, and others.
</P
><P
>&#13;You can find out where your distribution is logging to by looking at
your <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/syslog.conf</TT
> file. This is the file that tells
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>syslogd</TT
> (the system logging daemon) where to log various messages.
</P
><P
>&#13;You might also want to configure your log-rotating script or daemon to 
keep logs around longer so you have time to examine them. Take a look
at the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>logrotate</TT
> package on recent Red Hat distributions. Other
distributions likely have a similar process. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If your log files have been tampered with, see if you can determine
when the tampering started, and what sort of things appeared to be
tampered with. Are there large periods of time that cannot be accounted
for?  Checking backup tapes (if you have any) for untampered log files
is a good idea.
</P
><P
>&#13;Intruders typically modify log files in order to cover their
tracks, but they should still be checked for strange happenings. You
may notice the intruder attempting to gain entrance, or exploit a
program in order to obtain the root account. You might see log entries
before the intruder has time to modify them.
</P
><P
>&#13;You should also be sure to separate the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>auth</TT
> facility from other log 
data, including attempts to switch users using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>su</TT
>, login attempts,
and other user accounting information.
</P
><P
>&#13;If possible, configure <TT
CLASS="literal"
>syslog</TT
> to send a copy of the most important
data to a secure system.  This will prevent an intruder from covering
his tracks by deleting his login/su/ftp/etc attempts.  See the
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>syslog.conf</TT
> man page, and refer to the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>@</TT
> option.
</P
><P
>&#13;There are several more advanced <TT
CLASS="literal"
>syslogd</TT
> programs out
there. Take a look at <A
HREF="http://www.core-sdi.com/ssyslog/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.core-sdi.com/ssyslog/</A
> for Secure Syslog. Secure
Syslog allows you to encrypt your syslog entries and make sure no one
has tampered with them. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Another <TT
CLASS="literal"
>syslogd</TT
> with more features is <A
HREF="http://www.balabit.hu/en/downloads/syslog-ng/"
TARGET="_top"
>syslog-ng</A
>. It allows you a lot more flexibility in your
logging and also can has your remote syslog streams to prevent
tampering. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Finally, log files are much less useful when no one is reading
them. Take some time out every once in a while to look over your log
files, and get a feeling for what they look like on a normal
day. Knowing this can help make unusual things stand out.

>10.1. Security Compromise Underway.</H2
><P
>&#13;Spotting a security compromise under way can be a tense
undertaking. How you react can have large consequences. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If the compromise you are seeing is a physical one, odds are you have
spotted someone who has broken into your home, office or lab. You
should notify your local authorities. In a lab, you might have
spotted someone trying to open a case or reboot a machine. Depending
on your authority and procedures, you might ask them to stop, or
contact your local security people. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If you have detected a local user trying to compromise your security,
the first thing to do is confirm they are in fact who you think they
are. Check the site they are logging in from. Is it the site they
normally log in from? No? Then use a non-electronic means of getting in
touch. For instance, call them on the phone or walk over to their
office/house and talk to them. If they agree that they are on, you can
ask them to explain what they were doing or tell them to cease doing
it. If they are not on, and have no idea what you are talking about,
odds are this incident requires further investigation. Look into such
incidents , and have lots of information before making any
accusations. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If you have detected a network compromise, the first thing to do (if
you are able) is to disconnect your network. If they are connected via
modem, unplug the modem cable; if they are connected via Ethernet,
unplug the Ethernet cable. This will prevent them from doing any
further damage, and they will probably see it as a network problem
rather than detection. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If you are unable to disconnect the network (if you have a busy site,
or you do not have physical control of your machines), the next best
step is to use something like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>tcp_wrappers</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ipfwadm</TT
>
to deny access from the intruder's site. 
</P
><P
>&#13;If you can't deny all people from the same site as the intruder,
locking the user's account will have to do. Note that locking an
account is not an easy thing. You have to keep in mind <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.rhosts</TT
> files,
FTP access, and a host of possible backdoors.
</P
><P
>&#13;After you have done one of the above (disconnected the network, denied
access from their site, and/or disabled their account), you need to
kill all their user processes and log them off. 
</P
><P
>&#13;You should monitor your site well for the next few minutes, as the
attacker will try to get back in. Perhaps using a different account,
and/or from a different network address.

what has been compromised.

</P

>&#13;Since Linux systems are getting easier and easier to install, you
might consider saving your config files, wiping your disk(s),
reinstalling, then restoring your user files and your
config files from backups. This will ensure that you have a new, clean system.  If
you have to restore files from the compromised system, be especially
cautious of any binaries that you restore, as they may be Trojan horses 
placed there by the intruder.
</P

obtaining root access.  Additionally, you'd like to keep any evidence
there is, so having a spare disk in the safe may make sense.

system is compromised, you can restore the data you need from
backups. Of course, some data is valuable to the attacker too, and they
will not only destroy it, they will steal it and have their own
copies; but at least you will still have the data. 
</P
><P
>&#13;You should check several backups back into the past before restoring a 
file that has been tampered with. The intruder could have compromised
your files long ago, and you could have made many successful backups

>&#13;Of course, there are also a raft of security concerns with

the site from which the attacker attacked your system. You can look up this
contact with <TT

email with all applicable log entries and dates and times. If you
spotted anything else distinctive about your intruder, you might
mention that too. After sending the email, you should (if you are so

your attacker, they might be able to talk to the admin of the site
where they are coming from and so on.

><P
>&#13;<EM
>authentication:</EM
> The process of knowing that the data
received is the same as the data that was sent, and that the claimed
sender is in fact the actual sender.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>bastion Host:</EM
> A computer system that must be highly
secured because it is vulnerable to attack, usually because it is
exposed to the Internet and is a main point of contact for users of
internal networks.  It gets its name from the highly fortified
projects on the outer walls of medieval castles.  Bastions overlook
critical areas of defense, usually having strong walls, room for
extra troops, and the occasional useful tub of boiling hot oil for
discouraging attackers.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>buffer overflow:</EM
> Common coding style is to never
allocate large enough buffers, and to not check for overflows.  When
such buffers overflow, the executing program (daemon or set-uid
program) can be tricked in doing some other things.  Generally this
works by overwriting a function's return address on the stack to point
to another location.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>denial of service:</EM
> An attack that consumes the
resources on your computer for things it was 
not intended to be doing, thus preventing normal use of your network
resources for legitimate purposes.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>dual-homed Host:</EM
> A general-purpose computer system that
has at least two network interfaces.
</P

> A component or set of components that restricts
access between a protected network and the Internet, or between other
sets of networks.

><P
>&#13;<EM
>host:</EM
> A computer system attached to a network.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>IP spoofing:</EM
> IP Spoofing is a complex technical attack
that is made up of several components.  It is a security exploit that
works by tricking computers in a trust relationship into thinking that
you are someone that you really aren't.  There is an extensive paper
written by daemon9, route, and infinity in the Volume Seven, Issue
Forty-Eight issue of Phrack Magazine.
</P
></LI
><LI

>&#13;<EM
>non-repudiation:</EM
> The property of a receiver being able
to prove that the sender of some data did in fact send the data even
though the sender might later deny ever having sent it. 
</P

><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>packet:</EM
> The fundamental unit of communication on the
Internet.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>packet filtering:</EM
> The action a device takes to
selectively control the flow of data to and from a network.  Packet
filters allow or block packets, usually while routing them from one
network to another (most often from the Internet to an internal
network, and vice-versa). To accomplish packet filtering, you set up
rules that specify what types of packets (those to or from a
particular IP address or port) are to be allowed and what types are to
be blocked.
</P

network and an external network, in order to provide an additional
layer of security.  A perimeter network is sometimes called a DMZ.

> A program that deals with external
servers on behalf of internal clients.  Proxy clients talk to proxy
servers, which relay approved client requests to real servers, and
relay answers back to clients.

><LI
><P
>&#13; Is it more secure to compile driver support directly into the
kernel, instead of making it a module?
</P
><P
>&#13;Answer: Some people think it is better to disable the ability to load
device drivers using modules, because an intruder could load a Trojan
module or a module that could affect system security.
</P
><P
>&#13;However, in order to load modules, you must be root.  The module
object files are also only writable by root.  This means the intruder
would need root access to insert a module.  If the intruder gains root
access, there are more serious things to worry about than whether he
will load a module.
</P
><P
>&#13;Modules are for dynamically loading support for a particular device
that may be infrequently used.  On server machines, or firewalls for
instance, this is very unlikely to happen.  For this reason, it would
make more sense to compile support directly into the kernel for
machines acting as a server.  Modules are also slower than support
compiled directly in the kernel.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; Why does logging in as root from a remote machine always fail?
</P
><P
>&#13;Answer: See <A
HREF="#root-security"
>Section 4.2</A
>.  This is done
intentionally to prevent remote users from attempting to connect via
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>telnet</TT
> to your machine as <TT
CLASS="literal"
>root</TT
>, which is a serious
security
vulnerability, because then the root password would be transmitted, in
clear text, across the network.  Don't forget: potential intruders have time on their
side, and can run automated programs to find your
password. Additionally, this is done to keep a clear record of who
logged in, not just root.  
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; How do I enable shadow passwords on my Linux box?
</P
><P
>&#13;Answer:
</P
><P
>&#13;To enable shadow passwords, run <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pwconv</TT
> as root, and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
> should now exist, and be used by applications.
If you are using RH 4.2 or above, the PAM modules will automatically
adapt to the change from using normal <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> to shadow
passwords without any other change.
</P
><P
>&#13;Some background: shadow passwords is a mechanism for storing your
password in a file other than the normal <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> file.  This has
several advantages.  The first one is that the shadow file,
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
>, is only readable by root, unlike <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
>,
which must remain readable by everyone.  The other advantage is that as the
administrator, you can enable or disable accounts without everyone
knowing the status of other users' accounts.
</P
><P
>&#13;The <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> file is then used to store user and group names, used
by programs like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/bin/ls</TT
> to map the user ID to the proper user name
in a directory listing.
</P
><P
>&#13;The <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
> file then only contains the user name and his/her
password, and perhaps accounting information, like when the account
expires, etc.
</P
><P
>&#13;To enable shadow passwords, run <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pwconv</TT
> as root, and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
> should now exist, and be used by applications.
Since you are using RH 4.2 or above, the PAM modules will automatically
adapt to the change from using normal <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> to shadow
passwords without any other change.
</P
><P
>&#13;Since you're interested in securing your passwords, perhaps you would
also be interested in generating good passwords to begin with.  For
this you can use the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pam_cracklib</TT
> module, which is part of PAM.  It
runs your password against the Crack libraries to help you decide if
it is too-easily guessable by password-cracking programs.

><P
>&#13;By subscribing to the security alert mailing lists, and keeping
current, you can do a lot towards securing your machine. If you pay
attention to your log files and run something like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>tripwire</TT
> regularly,
you can do even more. 
</P
><P
>&#13;A reasonable level of computer security is not difficult to maintain
on a home machine. More effort is required on business machines, but
Linux can indeed be a secure platform. Due to the nature of Linux
development, security fixes often come out much faster than they do on
commercial operating systems, making Linux an ideal platform when
security is a requirement.
