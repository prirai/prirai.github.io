He left a four-page anti-immigrant manifesto containing standard &quot;ethnic displacement&quot; and &quot;race mixing&quot; white nationalist talking points, refers to immigrants as &quot;invaders&quot;, and professes admiration for the New Zealand Christchurch mass shooting.

I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.&quot; He shouted &quot;All Jews must die&quot; as he carried out the attack. The shooting was the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the United States in history. The intervening years between 2016 and 2018 saw rising indicators of antisemitism in American public life, including a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017 in context of rising hate crimes against other groups including Muslims and African Americans as reported by the FBI, a wave of vandalizations of hundreds of Jewish gravestones in Pennsylvania and Missouri, and a multiplication by 2 of antisemitic incidents on university campuses. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46002549">2</a></li>

Between 10 to 15 minutes later, Bush entered the Kroger, shot Stallard inside, then Jones in the parking lot. He then exchanged gunfire with a bystander, who saw him shoot Jones.
