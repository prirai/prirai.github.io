<p>Here's an ordered list of Marxist books and essays that can serve as a reading list / study plan.</p>
<p>This isn't a comprehensive list: these are the ones I wish I could go back in time to give to middle-school me.</p>
<p>It alternates between theory, history, and psychology.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm">Engels - Principles of Communism</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS4cpvvLeYo&amp;t=14s">Audiobook</a> A glossary of terms to get us all on the same page.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm">Lenin - The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism</a>. The best short essay introduction to Marxism.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm">Engels - Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS4cpvvLeYo&amp;list=PL0-IkmzWbjobt3oC7Mhq9kHWVbBKRtyg8">audiobook</a> Simply the best primer on scientific socialism written by one of its founders. Starts from its historical foundations, to its theoretical underpinnings.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto">The Communist Manifesto</a>. Much less informative, and not as mature a work as Socialism, Utopian and scientific, but should still be read. Captures the energy and urgency of the communist movement.</li>
<li>(Optional) <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:24c9a942f97f99c1816a344292b7baff5f289986&amp;dn=The+Meaning+of+Marxism+-+Paul+D%27Amato.epub">Paul D’Amatto - the meaning of Marxism</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX9h_ApIRc0&amp;list=PL0-IkmzWbjoaJXdItsv-JPqE7gBW2M80o">Youtube audiobook</a>.

<li><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/">Lenin - State and Revolution</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GrP0EVJkVE&amp;list=PL0-IkmzWbjoatUez9-2vaAvB78afoKNRC">Audiobook</a>. The most important political work of the 20th century. Through a clarifying and critical analysis of Marx and Engels's thoughts on the state, Lenin explains the class nature of the state, and argues convincingly for the creation of proletarian states: the vehicle which can bring about socialism. This strategy and analysis would be adopted and sucessfully carried out in dozens of countries following this blueprint. Focuses on the most important question for all socialists: What is to be done?</li>
<li>Michael Parenti - Blackshirts and Reds. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-IkmzWbjoak57jcXDh1rY4n7Ic-EVsE">Youtube audiobook</a>. Brandolini's law: It takes 10x the amount of energy required to refute bullshit, than it does to produce it... IE, it's far easier to learn theory, than it is to undo a lifetime of anti-communist propaganda. This book explains <em>why</em> that cradle-to-grave anti-communist indoctrination process exists (from school to workplace to media), and why the mere existence of communist countries is so threatening to the wealthy. It gives an overview of the soviet experiment: what it achieved for humanity, the history of its anti-fascist struggle, and its struggle for human equality, and how its overthrow, and how the US entrenchment of neoliberal globalization and neo-colonialism has wrought destruction in the global south.</li>
<li><a href="http://gowans.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/do-publicly-owned-planned-economies-work">Stephen Gowans - Do Publicly Owned, Planned Economies Work?</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYf3gZZFa0k&amp;list=PL0-IkmzWbjobDdDbSC_YgZfV94BQiRIB8">audiobook</a> A great essay to accompany the previous book, about the tremendous success of the soviet planned economy, and the real reasons for the USSR's downfall.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/Marx_Critque_of_the_Gotha_Programme.pdf">Marx - Critique of the Gotha Programme</a> An invaluable essay from Marx dissecting a weak socialist party program, where Marx also outlines the transition from capitalism to communism, as well as a description of how a labor-time based economy can function.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm">Rosa Luxemburg - Reform or Revolution</a> . <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhzmaUofLS8&amp;list=PL0-IkmzWbjoYqO_Yec4sWzPeeFXMOkPWs">Audiobook</a>.

The chapters on the US constitution and civil wars are excellent.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Life_(Fidel_Castro_autobiography)">Fidel Castro - My Life</a> (Audiobook on torrents). This book will get you into the mindset of what it means to be a socialist: to rebel, to teach, to be a good comrade, and to fight for the betterment of humanity. Castro was an active part of many of the most important events of the 20th century; but not only is his wisdom on these events invaluable, his life was truly extraordinary.

Sakai - Settlers: the Mythology of the White Proletariat</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-IkmzWbjoZEICtu8cocz_3oRFS6L7wN">audiobook</a>. The most important US history book. Analyzes the US's settler-colonialist foundations, its history of genocide, exploitation, social bribery, and the spoils that went to those who willingly absorbed into whiteness and the murican dream (even if they had to kill indians to get some cheap land to do so.)
