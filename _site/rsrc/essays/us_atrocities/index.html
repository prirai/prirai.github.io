<li>On February 3rd, 2022, US troops <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/us-special-forces-kill-suspected-jihadists-in-north-west-syria-raid">murdered 6 children and 4 women</a> during a raid in Syria.</li>
<li>On December 2021, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/civilian-casualty-files.html#credible-reports">The New York Times published <em>the Civilian Casualty Files</em></a>. <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/12/23/pers-d23.html">These</a> <a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/the-civilian-casualty-files-expose-the-pentagon-killing-fields-in-west-asia/article38197303.ece#!">files</a> reveal that the US military, under the Obama and Trump administrations, deliberately killed civilians, including children in Iraq and Syria and that the US military systematically covered it up. The Times reported that they uncovered “the deaths of thousands of civilians, many of them children.” The data in the Pentagon reports claimed that children were killed or injured in 27 percent of air strikes that resulted in civilian casualties; The Times' on-the-ground verification found the number was 62 percent. For example, more than 120 civilians were killed in a single airstrike in July 2016 in the hamlet of Tokhar in northern Syria. The US military claimed it was targeting ISIS, but confronted with evidence that the victims were innocent farmers. The military report on the slaughter at Tokhar found “no evidence of negligence or wrongdoing” and that “no further action” was necessary. The reports reveal that the US military deliberately chose to drop bombs on children they saw on camera. In a particularly powerful segment of her article on the “human toll,” Khan describes how the US military knowingly bombed children playing on a roof, killing a family of 11. There was no ISIS presence.</li>
<li>On August 17th, 2021, the US government seized <a href="https://archive.ph/Jfudb">$9.5B dollars of funds belonging to the Central Bank of Afghanistan</a>, claiming that the frozen assets will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/afghan-central-bank-says-us-plan-frozen-funds-an-injustice-2022-02-12/">now be used to satisfy lawsuits over the September 11th, 2001 attacks, which Afghanistan had nothing to do with.</a>.</li>
<li>On February 25th, 2021, in his first month in office, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-bombs-facilities-syria-used-iran-backed-militia-n1258912">Biden bombs Syria</a>, killing at least 22 people. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby called the bombing “proportionate” and “defensive.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/25/us-airstrike-syria-iran-militia">2</a></li>
<li>On November 27th, 2020, Israel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohsen_Fakhrizadeh">assassinated Iranian nuclear physicist Moshen Fakhrizadeh</a> via a satellite controlled vehicle-mounted machine gun, which then self-detonated after killing him. The attack was likely commited by Israel with US help and foreknowledge.</li>
<li>In 2020, former US drone operator <a href="https://archive.is/K8LF7">Brandon Bryant revealed the full extent of his work piloting drones in Afghanistan</a> from his workspace near Las Vegas, from 2006-2011. He reached his breaking point with the US military after killing a child in Afghanistan that his superiors told him was “a dog.” He recalls the moment: After firing a Hellfire missile at a building containing his target, he saw a child exit the building just as the missile struck. When he alerted his superiors about the situation after reviewing the tape, he was told “it was a f***ing dog, drop it.” During his time in the Air Force, Mr Bryant estimates he contributed directly to killing 13 people himself and says his squadron fired on 1,626 targets including women and children. Mr Bryant quit the military and began speaking out against the drone program, and calls the US worse than nazis.</li>
<li>On January 2nd, 2020, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/EJYI44G.jpg">President Donald Trump ordered the drone assassination</a> of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iraq-3-katyusha-rockets-fired-baghdad-airport-200102232817666.html">Iranian General Qassem Soleimani</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/5597ff0f046a67805cc233d5933a53ed">2</a>, in a blatant act of war against Iran. Soleimani was a beloved figure to the Iranian people, his death sending shockwaves among residents, and a 3-day national mourning period was declared. Hillary Mann Leverett, a former White House National Security official, said the killing of Soleimani was a &quot;declaration of war&quot; on Iran, and is &quot;equivalent to the Iranians assassinating the US defence secretary&quot;. The drone attack was part of several targeted <a href="https://www.fort-russ.com/2020/01/breaking-iranian-general-soleimani-killed-in-illegal-us-airstrikes-on-baghdad/">US airstrikes</a>, and comes in the wake of turmoil following <a href="https://www.axios.com/pentagon-airstrikes-syria-iraq-hezbollah-5f9800dd-b668-4ff7-a3d7-d987f031a1aa.html">another series of US airstrikes</a> in Iraq and Syria <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50951742">which killed 25 members of the Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah militia</a>, after which <a href="https://www.axios.com/us-embassy-baghdad-iraq-attacked-protestors-iran-6e700ad0-d9cc-49cb-868b-3225dc070bd4.html">outraged Iraqi protesters surrounded the US embassy in Baghdad</a>. In response, the US blamed &quot;Iranian infiltrators&quot; for the embassy attack, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/us-embassy-attack-750-troops-deployed-iraq-2ecf4632-2143-4531-bc1a-936cfd5e6553.html">deployed an additional 750 troops</a>, bolstering the 14k troops currently stationed in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dlyDNr6.jpg">~20 military bases surrounding Iran</a>. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi militia commander, was also killed in a pre-dawn raid on the same day. That evening, another US airstrike in Iraq <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Air-Strikes-Targeting-Iraqi-Militia-Kill-Six-Army-Source-20200103-0012.html">killed 6 people.</a></li>
<li>In September 2019, the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/afghanistan-dozens-civilians-killed-drone-attack-190919072728303.html">US killed at least 30 pine nut farmers, and injured 40 others via a drone attack</a> in the nangarhar province in Afghanistan. Malik Rahat Gul, a tribal elder in Wazir Tangi, said the air raid happened at a time when tired workers, mainly daily wage earners, had gathered near their tent after harvesting pine nuts in a field nearby. &quot;The workers had lit a bonfire and were sitting together when a drone targeted them&quot;. This marks the 18th year of war in Afghanistan.</li>
<li>In early 2018, US Navy Seal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Gallagher_(Navy_SEAL)">Eddie Gallagher stabbed a defenseless teenage captive to death in Iraq</a>. According to two SEAL witnesses, Gallagher said over the radio &quot;he's mine&quot; and walked up to the medic and prisoner, and without saying a word, killed the prisoner by stabbing him repeatedly with his hunting knife. Gallagher and his commanding officer, Lieutenant Jake Portier, then posed for photographs of them standing over the body with some other nearby SEALs. Gallagher then text messaged a friend in California a picture himself holding the dead captive's head by the hair with the explanation &quot;Good story behind this, got him with my hunting knife.” After he was imprisoned, <a href="http://archive.is/9b2fR">Gallagher's other crimes came to light</a>: fellow soldiers said they witnessed Gallagher shooting and killing an unarmed old man in a white robe, as well as a young girl walking with other girls. Gallagher boasted that he averaged three kills a day over 80 days, including four women. In video interviews with investigators, multiple SEALs described how he would go on solo “gun runs,” emptying loads of heavy machine gun fire into neighborhoods with no apparent targets. “I think he just wants to kill anybody he can,” Corey Scott, a medic from the platoon, told Navy investigators. After his case went public, it became a conservative rallying cry: A website soliciting donations for his defense raised &gt; $375k, and a prominent veterans’ apparel maker sold “Free Eddie” T-shirts. Spurred on by his family, 40 Republican members of Congress signed a letter in March calling for the Navy to free him, and soon after, US President Trump had him released from prison to house arrest. In July, 2019, he was acquitted of all charges. Gallagher was one of three military personnel accused or convicted of war crimes on whose behalf Trump had intervened to pardon or promote. Trump told a rally audience days after his intervention, &quot;I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state.&quot; <a href="http://archive.is/hgUQC">Gallagher has now started a chain of companies selling clothing and nutritional supplements.</a></li>
<li>On April 14, 2018, the US, UK, and France <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/syria-air-strikes-us-uk-and-france-launch-attack-on-assad-regime">launched 100 more missiles</a> at 3 different targets in Syria, again claiming that the Syrian government used chemical attacks against its own citizens in douma as justification. On 10 April, the Syrian government again invited the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to send a team to investigate the sites of the alleged attacks. Trump, Macron, and May have all issued statements saying that this is not an intervention in the Syrian civil war. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/syria-air-strikes-us-uk-and-france-launch-attack-on-assad-regime">1</a>. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronjmate/status/1198423637805666305">leaked email</a> in Nov, 2019, <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/01/02/opcw-leaks-expose-criminal-syria-cover-up-and-us-media-is-silent/">an OPCW whistleblower stated that the US fabricated the evidence</a>, and used it justify the air-strike. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/opcw-douma/document/Internal-OPCW-E-Mail/Internal-OPCW-E-Mail.pdf">2</a></li>
<li>Starting in June 2017, photos and videos from Syrian civilians in Raqqa showed that the US-backed coalition in Syria was illegally using <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/north-africa-west-asia/josepha-ivanka-wessels/white-phosphorus-over-raqqa">white phosphorus</a> in civilian areas. White phosphorus can burn human flesh down to the bone, and wounds can reignite up to days later. “No matter how white phosphorus is used, it poses a high risk of horrific and long-lasting harm in crowded cities like Raqqa and Mosul and any other areas with concentrations of civilians,” said <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/stephen-goose">Steve Goose</a>, arms director at Human Rights Watch. One attack on an internet cafe killed at least 20 civilians, while other deaths are still being confirmed. One of those civilians killed was in the process of sending a report to Humans Rights Watch, when the cafe was struck. The US killed 273 syrian civilians in April, slightly more than the number killed by ISIS. A US attack in July killed another 50 civilians. In August, the US killed another 60+ civilians. On May 17th, 2020, <a href="https://www.ibtimes.sg/trump-ordered-us-forces-burn-hectares-wheat-field-syria-amid-covid-19-pandemicrussia-media-45482">the US firebombed over 200 acres of wheat fields in Syria, leaving many food insecure.</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/middleeast/raqqa-syria-white-phosphorus.html">1</a>,<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/14/iraq/syria-danger-us-white-phosphorus">2</a>,<a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/north-africa-west-asia/josepha-ivanka-wessels/white-phosphorus-over-raqqa">3</a></li>
<li>On April 4th, 2017, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Shaykhun_chemical_attack">Khan Shaykhun chemical attack</a>, Trump ordered an airstrike of 59 tomahawk cruise missiles (worth $70 million) fired at the Shayrat air base in Syria (one that Trump claims is the source of the chemical attack) in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Shayrat_missile_strike">2017 Shayrat Missile Strike</a>. This is the first attack by the US directly targeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Socialist_Ba%27ath_Party_%E2%80%93_Syria_Region">Ba'athist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_government">Syrian government</a> forces, who are closely allied with Russia. Russian Prime Minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitry_Medvedev">Dimitry Medvedev</a> said the attack brought the U.S. &quot;within an inch&quot; of clashing with the Russian military, and could've sparked a nuclear war. The attack was praised by US politicians on both sides of the aisle, as well &gt;30 countries. Over 700 children have been killed US coalition airstrikes in Iraq and Syria since August 2014. The US conducted another airstrike against Syria on June 7th, 2017.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Shayrat_missile_strike">1</a></li>
<li>On March 21st, 2017, A US airstrike <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/at-least-30-dead-after-air-strike-hits-syrian-school-1.3020369">killed at least 30 Syrian civilians</a> in an airstrike on a school in the Raqqa province. The week before, 49 people were killed when US warplanes fired on a target in in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_al-Jinah_airstrike">2017 al-Jinah airstrike</a>, a village in western <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/search/search-7.1213540?tag_location=Aleppo&amp;article=true">Aleppo</a> province. US officials said the attack had hit a building where al-Qaeda operatives were meeting, but residents said the warplanes had struck a mosque where hundreds of people had gathered for a weekly religious meeting. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_al-Jinah_airstrike">1</a></li>
<li>On March 17th, 2017, A US airstrike killed ~112 civilians in Mosul, Iraq. In response, US Defense Secretary James Mattis said, &quot;There is no military force in the world that is proven more sensitive to civilian casualties.&quot; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/27/middleeast/mosul-civilian-deaths/">1</a></li>
<li>On February 15th, 2017, US-backed Saudi planes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/15/yemen-funeral-saudi-led-airstrike-houthi-insurgents">bombed a funeral</a> in Yemen, killing 5 women and wounding dozens more. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2015%E2%80%93present)">2015 - Present Yemeni Civil War</a>, 16,200 people have been killed including 10,000 civilians, 3 million have been displaced and left homeless, and over 200,000 people are facing shortages of food, water and medicine. The US has used drone bombers in Yemen, and has supported Saudi interests in the region, with military contracts providing weapons and planes. The US has weapons contracts with Saudi Arabia valuing over $110 billion. In August 2018, Saudi planes bombed a school bus, killing 50, including 40 children, and wounding another 80.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2015%E2%80%93present)">1</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/15/yemen-funeral-saudi-led-airstrike-houthi-insurgents">2</a>, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/13/middleeast/yemen-children-school-bus-strike-intl/index.html">3</a></li>
<li>In 2010, President Obama <a href="http://www.salon.com/2010/04/07/assassinations_2/">directed the CIA</a> to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/">assassinate an American citizen</a> in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, despite the fact that he had never been charged with any crime, killing him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/sep/30/anwar-al-awlaki-yemen-live">with a September, 2011 drone strike</a>. Two weeks later, a separate CIA drone strike in Yemen <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/10/20/the_killing_of_awlakis_16_year_old_son/">killed his 16-year-old American-born son</a>, Abdulrahman, along with the boy’s 17-year-old cousin and several other innocent Yemenis. In January 2017, Trump ordered a SEAL strike, and reports from Yemen <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-yemen-qaeda-idUKKBN15D094">quickly surfaced</a> that 30 people were killed, including 10 women and children. Among the dead: the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar Awlaki, sister of the 16 year old killed by Obama. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/">1</a></li>
<li>In 2016, the US under Obama dropped <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html">26,171 bombs in the Middle East and North Africa</a>, up 3000 from the previous year. The countries bombed include Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, and Somalia. He authorized <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2017/01/17/obamas-covert-drone-war-numbers-ten-times-strikes-bush/">10 times more drone strikes</a> than George W Bush. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html">1</a></li>
<li>In January 2015, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/drones-dream-yemeni-teenager-mohammed-tuaiman-death-cia-strike?CMP=share_btn_tw">US killed 13-year-old Mohammed Tuaiman in Yemen</a> with a drone strike. A month earlier, the guardian interviewed him, and he was quoted as saying: &quot;“A lot of the kids in this area wake up from sleeping because of nightmares from them and some now have mental problems. They turned our area into hell and continuous horror, day and night, we even dream of them in our sleep...In their eyes, we don’t deserve to live like people in the rest of the world and we don’t have feelings or emotions or cry or feel pain like all the other humans around the world.” In 2011 an unmanned combat drone killed his father and teenage brother as they were out herding the family’s camels. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/drones-dream-yemeni-teenager-mohammed-tuaiman-death-cia-strike?CMP=share_btn_tw">1</a></li>
<li>Since 2013, The US has intervened militarily in the ongoing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War#Western_coalition">Syrian Civil War</a>, with airstrikes, naval bombardments, and funding and training Syrian Islamic and secular insurgents fighting to topple the Syrian government. Many have labeled the struggle as a proxy war between US and Russian interests in the Middle East, in a highly unstable region. Between 500-700 civilians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Syria#cite_note-airwars.org-328">have been killed by coalition airstrikes</a>, and over 50,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant">ISIL</a> militants and pro-bashad fighters have been killed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Syria">1</a></li>
<li>From 2011 up to the present day, the US ousted Mummar Gaddafi in Libya, and began conducting an extensive bombing campaign (&gt;110 tomahawk cruise missiles) in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)">Libyan Civil Wars of 2011 and 2014</a>. This includes 7,700 air strikes, resulting in 30,000 -100,000 deaths. Loyalist towns were bombed to rubble and ethnically cleansed, and the country is in chaos as Western-trained and armed Islamist militias seize territory and oil facilities and vie for power. The Misrata militia, trained and armed by Western special forces, is one of the most violent and powerful in the world.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)">1</a> The country has since collapsed into a chaos of child soldiers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration">slavery</a>, and violence between extremist groups, a haunting repetition of what US imperialism has left in its wake in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/470321-libya-gaddafi-spokesman-interview/">An interview with Gaddafi's former spokesman about the US overthrow of Libya.</a>.</li>
<li>US drone operator turned whistleblower <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-military-drone-nazis-brandon-bryant-a9324011.html">Brandon Bryant</a> told stories about his time as a drone operator in Afghanistan from 2006-2011. He estimates that he contributed directly to killing 13 people himself and says his squadron fired on 1,626 targets including women and children. He tells of one instance of killing a child, with his superiors telling him &quot;it was a f**** dog, drop it&quot;. “That image on the screen is still in my head. Whenever I think about it, it still hurts me,” Mr Bryant said. “When I pulled the trigger, I knew that it was wrong. When the missile struck I knew in my soul I had become a murderer.” He tells of how his superiors would ridicule, punish, and threaten legal action against anyone who had misgivings about their orders. He believes that the US military is &quot;worse than the nazis.&quot;</li>
<li>In 2010, as part of a program by the Bush and Obama administrations to hinder the development of Iran's nuclear program, US NSA and cyber-command operatives, working with Israeli counterparts, developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet Virus</a>. The virus was originally designed to infect siemens microcontrollers, that controlled the rate of spinning gas centrifuges, causing them to spin out of control and explode, leading to a temporary setback in Iranian nuclear fissile material production. In a classic case of blowback, Stuxnet also infected nearly all computer networks around the world, including in the US, threatening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure">critical infrastructure</a>, such as water, electricity, telecommunication, transportation, and health networks. By releasing stuxnet, the US and Israel initiated the first use of, and began an arms race for this new type of war weapon: cyber-attacks that can harm critical infrastructure. A more comprehensive plan to destroy all of Iran's critical infrastructure via a country-wide cyber-attack, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitro_Zeus">Nitro-Zeus</a>, was also developed, and exposed by whistleblowers in the Alex Gibney documentary: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Days">Zero Days</a>, which details the history of the Stuxnet virus.</li>
<li>In 2010, Chelsea Manning's leak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak">Iraq War Logs</a> revealed US army reports on civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War">66,081 out of 109,000 recorded deaths were civilians</a>. They show that US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, and that US troops killed almost 700 civilians for coming too close to checkpoints, including pregnant women and the mentally ill, and countless other atrocities.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak">1</a></li>
<li>From 2000 up to the present day, the US has been carrying out a campaign of drone strikes and asassinations in the Middle East and Africa, including Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths, including women, <a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush/">children</a>, and US citizens. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_US_drone_strikes">1</a> Drone strikes are used by the military and the CIA to hunt down and kill people the <a href="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/KC_Heads01.png">Obama administration</a> has deemed — through secretive processes, without indictment or trial — worthy of execution.

<li>In 1990, The U.S. liberates Kuwait from Iraq in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">Gulf War</a>. Iraq’s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was formerly backed by the US when his regime invaded Iran in 1980, and before that was hired by the CIA in a botched assassination attempt on the then Iraqi president. During this costly eight-year war, the CIA built up Hussein’s forces with sophisticated arms, intelligence, training and financial backing, cementing Hussein’s power at home, and allowing him to crush the many internal rebellions that erupted from time to time, sometimes with poison gas. 20,000–35,000 Iraqis were killed in the Gulf War, along with 75,000+ wounded. A vindictive U.N. embargo followed that several years later still denied Iraq the technological resources to recover its food production, medical services, and sanitation facilities. As late as 1993, CNN reported that nearly 300,000 Iraqi children were suffering from malnutrition. Deaths exceeded the normal rate by 125,000 yearly, mostly affecting ‘the poor, their infants, children, chronically ill, and elderly’.

This was the first application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_Doctrine">Eisenhower Doctrine</a> under which the U.S. announced that it would intervene to protect regimes it considered threatened by international <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">communism</a>. The goal of the operation was to bolster the pro-Western Lebanese government of President Camille Chamoun against internal opposition and threats from Syria and Egypt. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Lebanon_crisis">1</a></li>
<li>In 1953, the CIA in Iran overthrows the democratically elected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh">Mohammed Mossadegh</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">military coup</a>, after he threatened to nationalize British oil. The CIA replaces him with a dictator, the Shah of Iran, whose secret police, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK">SAVAK</a>, is as brutal as the Gestapo. After the initial coup failed and the Shah and his family fled to Italy, the CIA payed millions of dollars to bribe military officers and pay gangsters to unleash violence in the streets of Tehran. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">1</a></li>
<li>In 1949, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1949_Syrian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">US aided a Syrian coup d'état</a>. The democratically elected government of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shukri_al-Quwatli">Shukri al-Quwatli</a> was overthrown by a junta led by the Syrian Army chief of staff at the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husni_al-Za%27im">Husni al-Za'im</a>,who became President of Syria on 11 April 1949.

<li>In 2017, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#Puerto_Rico">Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico</a>, leaving 3.4 million without electricity and fuel, and causing an estimated $50 Billion in damage. 55% of Puerto Ricans have no potable water, in one of the worst humanitarian crises in decades.

The US response has been dismal, leading many to believe that the US prefers a decapitalized Puerto Rico. On September 29, San Juan Mayor Cruz held a press conference to plead for aid and to highlight failures by FEMA, saying, &quot;This is what we got last night. Four pallets of water, three pallets of meals, and 12 pallets of infant food — which, I gave them to the people of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comer%C3%ADo,_Puerto_Rico">Comerío</a>, where people are drinking off a creek.

<li>Following a series of terrorist attacks against Cuba (such as the bombing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubana_Flight_455">Cuban commercial flight 455</a>, that originated from anti-Castro Cuban exile groups in the US, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_66">Alpha 66</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=F4_Commandos&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">F4 Commandos</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_American_National_Foundation">Cuban American National Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_to_the_Rescue">Brothers to the Rescue</a>), the Cuban government sent spies to infiltrate these insurgent groups operating in Miami. Afterwards, the Cuban government then provided 175 pages of documents to FBI agents investigating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Posada_Carriles">Posada Carriles's</a> (a former CIA operative) role in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Cuba_hotel_bombings">1997 terrorist bombings in Havana</a>, but the FBI failed to use the evidence to follow up on Posada. Instead, they used it to uncover and imprison the Cuban spies, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Five">Cuban Five</a>. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Five#cite_note-18">18]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Five#cite_note-19">19]</a>. The Cuban Five said they were spying on Miami's Cuban exile community, not the US government. They were imprisoned from 1998, until their eventual release via a prisoner swap in 2014. The terrorist bomber Posada Carriles (who admitted to planning 6 bombings of Havana Hotels and Restaurants) lived in Miami and was safeguarded by the US government until his death in 2018. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Posada_Carriles">2</a></li>
<li>In 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">a coup in Honduras</a> has led to severe repression and death squad murders of political opponents, union organizers and journalists. At the time of the coup, U.S. officials denied any role in the coup and used semantics to avoid cutting off U.S. military aid as required under U.S. law. But two Wikileaks cables revealed that the U.S. Embassy, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was the main power broker in managing the aftermath of the coup and forming a government that is now repressing and murdering its people, including popular leader Berta Cáceres. The two men who killed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berta_C%C3%A1ceres">Berta Cáceres</a> were trained in the US. A former soldier with the US-trained special forces units of the Honduran military asserted that Caceres' name was included on a hitlist distributed to them months before her assassination.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berta_C%C3%A1ceres#cite_note-66">66]</a> According to a February 2017 investigation by <em>The Guardian</em>, court papers purport to show that three of the eight people arrested in connection with the assassination are linked to the US-trained elite troops. Two of them, Maj Mariano Díaz and Lt Douglas Giovanny Bustillo, received military training in the US.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berta_C%C3%A1ceres#cite_note-67">1</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">2</a></li>
<li>In 1996, investigative journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb">Gary Webb</a> exposed a CIA-run business of selling cocaine produced in Nicaragua, to help fund the anti-communist Contras in their fight against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. These drugs were mostly sold to black communities in California, and helped spark the Crack epidemic. Several of the US dealers such as such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Freeway%22_Rick_Ross">Ross</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Danilo_Bland%C3%B3n">Oscar Danilo Blandon</a>, were found to have CIA and DEA ties. Webb's reports were suppressed in the news media. In 1997, Webb stated: &quot;If we had met five years ago, you wouldn't have found a more staunch defender of the newspaper industry than me ... And then I wrote some stories that made me realize how sadly misplaced my bliss had been. The reason I'd enjoyed such smooth sailing for so long hadn't been, as I'd assumed, because I was careful and diligent and good at my job ... The truth was that, in all those years, I hadn't written anything important enough to suppress.&quot; In 2004, Webb was found dead in his home, shot in the back of the head twice. His death was ruled a suicide.</li>
<li>In 1990 in Haiti, competing against 10 comparatively wealthy white candidates, leftist priest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Bertrand_Aristide">Jean-Bertrand Aristide</a> captures 68 percent of the vote. A few months later, the CIA-backed military <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Haitian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">deposes him in a coup</a>. More military dictators brutalize the country, as thousands of Haitian refugees escape the turmoil in barely seaworthy boats. The CIA &quot;paid key members of the coup regime forces, identified as drug traffickers, for information from the mid-1980s at least until the coup.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#1991:_Haiti">1</a> Coup leaders Cédras and François had received military training in the United States. As popular opinion called for Aristide’s return, the CIA began a disinformation campaign painting the courageous priest as mentally unstable.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201015135126/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-10-31-mn-51780-story.html">2</a> In 1994, Aristide was allowed to return back to Haiti after being 3 years in forced exile. The US demanded Aristide to drop his leftist programs for social reform, and adopt harsh neoliberal economic reforms instead. The US used &quot;most brutal anti-Aristide elements&quot; to pressure Aristide to abandon his ambitious programs.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Uphold_Democracy">3</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_for_the_Advancement_and_Progress_of_Ha%C3%AFti">4</a>,<a href="https://chomsky.info/200809__/">5</a>,<a href="https://chomsky.info/20090612/">6</a>,<a href="https://chomsky.info/20040731/">7</a> In 2004 Aristide was again overthrown by a military coup led by the US.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Haitian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">8</a></li>
<li>In 1989, the U.S. invades Panama with 26k troops to overthrow a dictator of its own making, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Noriega">General Manuel Noriega</a>, with the stated goal of &quot;Defending democracy and human rights in Panama&quot;. Noriega had been on the CIA’s payroll since 1966, collecting at least $100,000 per year from the U.S. Treasury. As he rose to be the de facto ruler of Panama, he became even more valuable to the CIA, reporting on meetings with Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and supporting U.S. covert wars in Central America, and had been transporting drugs with the CIA’s knowledge since 1972. By the late 80s, Noriega’s growing independence and intransigence had angered Washington. The UN human rights commission estimates that around 4,000 people were killed by US troops (The US claims only 250 people). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Noriega">1</a> The US military bombed urban neighborhoods, executed hundreds of civilians, and even tested new experimental weapons. The Panama invasion violates both the UN and OAS charter, which prohibits the invasions of a sovereign country or their territorial integrity, as well as the Geneva conventions. All the major US media supported the invasion: the New York Times, Wallstreet Journal, The Washington Post, the LA times, CBS, and NBC. Michael Parenti observes in his observation of media complicity with the invasion: &quot;The media is not <em>favorable</em> to corporate america, they <strong>are</strong> corporate america.&quot; The UN voted on Dec 29th 1989 overwhelming to condemn the invasion as a &quot;flagrant violation of international law&quot;. No US soldier or general has been tried for these war crimes, despite the UN commission, or the dozens of eyewitness accounts by Panamanians. These atrocities are chronicled in the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGIio2qMnto">The Panama Deception.</a></li>
<li>In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. supplied military equipment and substantial aid for the Columbian government in their civil war to fight against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia">FARC</a>, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Colombia">Plan Columbia</a>. The weapons, ostensibly delivered for use against narcotics traffickers, was being used by the Colombian military to commit abuses in the name of “counter-insurgency.” One estimate is that 67,000 deaths have occurred from the 1960s to recent years due to support by the U.S. of Colombian state terrorism. Another 1994 Amnesty International report, stated that more than 20,000 people were killed for political reasons in Colombia since 1986, mainly by the military and its paramilitary allies.</li>
<li>In 1987, the former CIA Station Chief in Angola in 1976, <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htm">John Stockwell</a>, testified to Congress and told a grisly tale of US involvement on behalf of business interests in Latin America. He cited covert operations in Nicaragua, Panama, Guatemala, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. Over the course of his testimony, he estimated that given the bombings of water supplies and other essential infrastructure, the invasions, the coups, that the United States, on its quest for empire, has been responsible for <strong>6,000,000 deaths.</strong> The CIA retaliated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockwell">suing him into bankruptcy</a>. <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htm">1</a></li>
<li>From 1981-90, the U.S. government attempted to topple the government of Nicaragua in so called &quot;Contra war&quot; or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Revolution">&quot;Nicaraguan Revolution&quot;</a>. The US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Nicaragua">secretly</a> armed, trained and funded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras">Contras</a>, a terrorist group based in Honduras that was created to sabotage Nicaragua and to destabilize the Nicaraguan government. As part of the training, the CIA distributed a detailed &quot;terror manual&quot; entitled &quot;Psychological Operations in Guerrilla War,&quot; which instructed the Contras, among other things, on how to blow up public buildings, to assassinate judges, to create martyrs, and to blackmail ordinary citizens. In 1986, the Nicaraguan government under the Sandinistas shot down a C-123 transport plane carrying military supplies to the Contras. The lone survivor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Hasenfus">Eugene Hasenfus</a>, turned out to be a CIA employee, as the two dead pilots, contradicting Reagan's claims that the US was not aiding the contras. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States">In 1984 Nicaragua responded to the crimes commited by the Contras by taking the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a>. ICJ ruled in favor of Nicaragua. ICJ condemnded the &quot;unlawful use of force&quot; (aka. international terrorism) by the US, ordered the US to terminate the crimes and pay massive reparations to Nicaragua. The US dismissed the ICJ judgement with total contempt and announced that they wont accept the jurisdiction of the court. Shortly after the ICJ ruling, the US directed Contras to attack “soft targets” — undefended civilian targets. Nicaragua then in 1985 went to the UN security counsil, which considered the resolution calling on all states to observe international law, but the US vetoed the resolution. The US now stands as the only state on record which has both been condemned by the ICJ for international terrorism and has vetoed a security counsil resolution calling on all states to observe international law. In 1987 Nicaragua went to UN general assembly, where similar resolution passed like in 1985 security counsil, with only the US with Israel and El Salvador opposing it.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/28/world/world-court-supports-nicaragua-after-us-rejected-judges-role.html">1</a>,<a href="https://chomsky.info/200205__02/">2</a>,<a href="https://chomsky.info/200303__/">3</a>,<a href="https://chomsky.info/198803__/">4</a> The Contra war ended in 1990, and estimated 30,000 people were killed.</li>
<li>In the 1980s the CIA supported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion_3-16_(Honduras)">Battalion 316</a>, a torture/assassination squad in Honduras, which kidnapped, tortured and killed hundreds of its citizens. Battalion 316 used shock and suffocation devices in interrogations , and prisoners often were kept naked and, when no longer useful, killed and buried in unmarked graves. Declassified documents and other sources show that the CIA and the U.S. Embassy knew of numerous crimes, including murder and torture, yet continued to support Battalion 316 and collaborate with its leaders. These constitute war crimes.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion_3-16_(Honduras)">1</a></li>
<li>In 1981, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Torrijos#Death">CIA assassinated Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos via a plane crash</a>, over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrijos%E2%80%93Carter_Treaties">Carter-Torrijos treaty</a>, which would return sovereignty of the Panama canal by 1999, and force a closure of all 26 US bases in Panama by 2000, and for his support of the Sandinistas. The US denies the assassination, but refused to allow evidence to be submitted as it would violate the Classified Information Procedures Act.</li>
<li>In 1981, in an act of biological warfare, <a href="https://archive.org/details/CovertActionInformationBulletinIssue17Summer1982USFakesDataInChemicalWar/page/n27/mode/2up">the US released a strain of Dengue fever into Cuba</a>, developed at Fort Dietrich. A total of 320k people were infected, 158 people died, including 101 children under the age of 15.</li>
<li>In 1980, In El Salvador, The Archbishop of San Salvador, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93scar_Romero">Oscar Romero</a>, pleads with President Carter to stop aiding the military government slaughtering his people. Carter refuses. Right-wing leader Roberto D’Aubuisson has Romero shot through the heart while saying Mass. The country soon dissolves into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War">civil war</a>, with the peasants in the hills fighting against the military government. The CIA and U.S. Armed Forces supply the government with overwhelming military and intelligence superiority, as well as over <a href="https://www.projectcensored.org/1-fierce-aerial-war-in-america-is-unreported-in-u-s-press/">3000 tons of US made bombs</a>, training death squads to roam the countryside, committing atrocities like that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mozote_massacre">El Mozote in 1982</a>, where 800 civilians were massacred. By 1992, some 63,000 Salvadorans were killed. Back then Salvador was controlled by a mafia of 13 families who owned 50% of the land and wealth. The 13 families were heavily linked with the United States. CIA provided weapons and military training to the Salvadorean Army, as well as $6B in aid, and US military training in Panama. As soon as the CIA discovered the priests were indoctrinating the masses, they began killing them.</li>
<li>In 1979, The CIA began to destabilize Grenada after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Bishop">Maurice Bishop</a> became president, for his marxist, pro-cuba, anti-racism, and anti-apartheid stances. The previous leader, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gairy">Eric Gairy</a>, was a British/US puppet who furthered imperialist interests in the region, sacked the treasury, presided over 47% unenemployment, and a 200% cost of living increase. His right wing gang / secret police, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoose_Gang">Mongoose gang</a>, ruthlessly tortured Leftists, sending his police to Pinochet's Argentina to learn torture techniques, and even murdered Maurice's father. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z-AxNFx88o">Under Bishop's leadership</a>, Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. Organisations for education (Center for Popular Education), health care, and youth affairs (National Youth Organization) were also established, as well as free education and health care. A literacy campaign lowered it to less than 5% in 3 years. The campaign against him resulted in his overthrow and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Grenada">invasion by the U.S. of Grenada</a> on October 25, 1983, with about 277 people dying.</li>
<li>In 1979, the US-backed dictator Anastasios Samoza II falls, beginning the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Revolution">Nicaraguan Revolution</a>. Remnants of his Guard will become the Contras, who fight a CIA-backed guerilla war against the left-wing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista_National_Liberation_Front">Sandinista</a> government throughout the 1980s, with Reagan authorizing covert support to anti-Sandinista forces. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Revolution">1</a></li>
<li>In 1976, several CIA-linked anti-Castro Cuban exiles and members of the Venezuelan secret police <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Directorate_of_Intelligence_and_Prevention_Services">DISIP</a> were responsible for a terrorist bomb attack on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubana_de_Aviaci%C3%B3n_Flight_455">Cuban flight 455</a>, killing 73 people. CIA venezuelan operative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Posada_Carriles">Luis Posada Carriles</a>, one of the bombers, fled and was granted amnesty in the US in 2007. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubana_de_Aviaci%C3%B3n_Flight_455">1</a></li>
<li>In 1976, The CIA backed an overthrow of Argentinan leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Mart%C3%ADnez_de_Per%C3%B3n">Isabel Martínez de Perón</a> by right wing anti-communist dictator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Rafael_Videla">Jorge Rafael Videla</a>. In 1983, two years after the return of a representative democratic government, he was prosecuted in the Trial of the Juntas for large-scale human rights abuses and crimes against humanity that took place under his rule, including kidnappings or forced disappearance, widespread torture and extrajudicial murder of activists, and political opponents as well as their families at secret concentration camps, and harboring nazis. An estimated 13,000 -30,000 political dissidents vanished during this period. Videla was also convicted of the theft of many babies born during the captivity of their mothers at the illegal detention centres and passing them on for illegal adoption by associates of the regime. In his defence, Videla maintains the female guerrilla detainees allowed themselves to fall pregnant in the belief they wouldn't be tortured or executed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Rafael_Videla">1</a></li>
<li>On 11 September 1973, The CIA backed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">military coup</a> to remove democratically elected socialist president Salvador Allende, in favor of right-wing dictator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>. His US-supported regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent that was unprecedented in the history of Chile, backed by the neoliberal free-market economic policies of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Boys">Chicago Boys</a>. Over-all, the regime left over 3,000 dead or &quot;dissappeared&quot;, tortured thousands of prisoners, and forced 200,000 Chileans into exile. He's known for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Grimaldi">Villa Grimaldi</a>, a torture complex, and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravan_of_Death">Caravan of Death</a>, a Chilean Army death squad guilty of countless atrocities, including dropping pregnant women and teenagers out of helicopters in the ocean, and executions where prisoners were shot by parts, over extended periods of time. Pinochet's forces are conservatively estimated to have killed over 11,000 people in his first year in power. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">1</a>, <a href="http://www.spunk.org/library/otherpol/critique/sp001280.html">2</a></li>
<li>In 1971 in Bolivia, after half a decade of CIA-inspired political turmoil, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows the leftist President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Torres">Juan Jose Torres</a>, eventually being kidnapped and murdered by CIA backed right wing death squads, as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">Operation Condor</a>. In the next two years, dictator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Banzer">Hugo Banzer</a> will have over 2,000 political opponents arrested without trial, then tortured, raped and executed. Banzer wwas trained at the U.S.-operated School of the Americas in Panama and later at Fort Hood, Texas. A few years later the Catholic Church denounced an army massacre of striking tin workers in 1975, Banzer, assisted by information provided by the CIA, was able to target and locate leftist priests and nuns. His anti-clergy strategy, known as the Banzer Plan, was adopted by nine other Latin American dictatorships in 1977.</li>
<li>In 1971, A CIA operative told a reporter he delivered a strain of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_swine_fever_virus#Cuba">African Swine Fever</a> virus from an army base in the Canal Zone to anti-Castro Cubans. An outbreak of the disease then occurred in Cuba, resulting in the slaughter of 500,000 pigs to prevent a nationwide animal epidemic. It was labeled the &quot;most alarming event&quot; of 1971 by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_swine_fever_virus#Cuba">1</a></li>
<li>Starting in the 1970s, a CIA-backed coalition of right wing governments in Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil, began <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">Operation Condor</a>, a campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents, with the stated aim of &quot;eliminating Marxist subversion.&quot; Victims included dissidents and leftists, union and peasant leaders, priests and nuns, students and teachers, intellectuals and suspected guerillas. An estimated 30,000 to 80,000 leftists or sympathizers were killed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">1</a></li>
<li>In 1969, amid a collapsing economy, labor and student strikes in Uruguay, CIA operative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Mitrione">Dan Mitrione</a> initiates a campaign of torture and violence against the left-wing student group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupamaros">Tuparamos</a>. Former Uruguayan police officials and CIA operatives stated Mitrione had taught torture techniques to Uruguayan police, including the use of electrical shocks delivered to his victims' mouths and genitals. It has been alleged that he used homeless people for training purposes, who were executed once they had served their purpose.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Mitrione#cite_note-9">1</a></li>
<li>In 1968, a CIA-organized military operation in Bolivia led by cuban exile and CIA agent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Rodr%C3%ADguez_(soldier)">Félix Rodríguez</a> captures legendary guerilla <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara">Che Guevara</a>, defeating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91ancahuaz%C3%BA_Guerrilla">Ñancahuazú Guerrilla</a>. The Bolivian president ordered his immediate execution to prevent worldwide calls for clemency, and the drama of a trial. Nazi war criminal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Barbie">Klaus Barbie</a> aka &quot;The Butcher of Lyon&quot;, advised and possibly helped the CIA orchestrate Guevara's eventual capture.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91ancahuaz%C3%BA_Guerrilla#cite_note-ObserverChe-1">1</a></li>
<li>In 1965, The US intervened in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Civil_War#April_Revolution_and_foreign_intervention">Dominican Civil War</a>, providing air support and 1,700 marines. This later transformed into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States">Organization of American States</a> occupation of the country. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Civil_War#April_Revolution_and_foreign_intervention">1</a></li>
<li>In 1964, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Brazilian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">A CIA-backed military coup in Brazil</a> overthrows the democratically elected government of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Goulart">Joao Goulart</a>. The junta that replaces it will, in the next two decades, become one of the most bloodthirsty in history. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humberto_de_Alencar_Castelo_Branco">General Castelo Branco</a> creates Latin America’s first death squads, or bands of secret police who hunt down communists and political opponents for torture, interrogation and murder. Later it is revealed that the CIA trained the death squads. Thousands were tortured, and hundreds were killed.</li>
<li>In the 1962 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis">Cuban missile crisis</a>, the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale nuclear attack and invasion was the only solution, nearly plunging the world into nuclear war. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis">1</a></li>
<li>From 1961 onward, The US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation">School of Americas</a>, a US Department of Defense institute in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Benning">Fort Benning</a>, Georgia, was assigned the specific goal of teaching &quot;anti-communist counterinsurgency training,&quot; to CIA-supported right wing paramilitaries. It trained more than 19,000 students from 36 countries in the western hemisphere, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation#Graduates_of_the_School_of_the_Americas">several Latin American dictators</a>, and, during the 1980s, included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture">torture</a> in its curriculum. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation">1</a></li>
<li>In 1961, in Ecuador, the CIA-backed military forces the democratically elected President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Velasco_Ibarra">José María Velasco Ibarra</a> to resign. Vice President Carlos Arosemana replaces him; the CIA fills the now vacant vice presidency with its own man. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Velasco_Ibarra">1</a></li>
<li>In 1961, the CIA assassinated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo">Rafael Trujillo</a>, a murderous dictator responsible for the deaths of more than 50,000 people, who Washington had supported since 1930. Trujillo’s business interests had grown so large (about 60 percent of the economy) that they had begun competing with American business interests. The US later provided troops on the side of the loyalists in the 1965 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Civil_War">Dominican civil war</a>, to ensure US interests. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Civil_War">1</a></li>
<li>After the Failed bay of pigs invasion, the CIA began <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Project">Operation Mongoose</a>, a series of covert operations to disrupt and destabilize Cuba. The operation included economic warfare, including an embargo against Cuba, “to induce failure of the Communist regime to supply Cuba's economic needs,” a diplomatic initiative to isolate Cuba, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations">psychological operations</a> “to turn the peoples' resentment increasingly against the regime.”[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#cite_note-history.state.gov-32">32]</a> The economic warfare prong of the operation also included the infiltration by the CIA of operatives to carry out many acts of sabotage against civilian targets, such as a railway bridge, a molasses storage facilities, an electric power plant, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar">sugar</a> harvest, notwithstanding Cuba’s repeated requests to the United States government to cease its terrorist operations.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#cite_note-33">33]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#cite_note-history.state.gov-32">32]</a> In addition, the CIA orchestrated a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_against_Fidel_Castro">assassination attempts against Fidel Castro</a>, head of government of Cuba, including attempts that entailed CIA collaboration with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_mafia">American mafia</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Project">1</a></li>
<li>In 1961, the CIA sent 1,500 Cuban exiles to invade Castro’s Cuba in the failed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion">Bay of Pigs Invasion</a>. B26 bombers attacked cuban airfields, providing initial air support. The planners had imagined that the invasion would spark a popular uprising against Castro -– which never happened. Several hundred were killed in the action. Castro's government returned the captured invaders for medical supplies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion">1</a></li>
<li>In 1959, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Haiti">US occupation of Haiti</a>, The U.S. military helps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Duvalier">&quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier</a> become dictator of Haiti. He creates his own private police force, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonton_Macoute">Tonton Macoutes</a>, who terrorize the population with machetes. They kill over 100,000 during the Duvalier family reign. The U.S. does not protest their dismal human rights record.</li>
<li>In 1958, The United States supported the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista">Batista dictatorship</a> in Cuba. Batista aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans. Eventually most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands, and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land. As such, Batista's increasingly corrupt and repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba's commercial interests, by negotiating lucrative relationships with both the American Mafia, who controlled the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large U.S.-based multinational companies who were awarded lucrative contracts. To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace—which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations—Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions; ultimately killing anywhere from hundreds to 20,000 people. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution">Cuban revolution</a>, the CIA launched a long campaign of terrorism against Cuba, training Cuban exiles in Florida, Central America and the Dominican Republic to commit assassinations and sabotage in Cuba. These include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba">cuban embargo</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Fidel_Castro">over 638 failed assasination attempts on fidel castro</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista">1</a></li>
<li>In 1954, the CIA overthrows the democratically elected Guatemalen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_%C3%81rbenz">Jacobo Árbenz</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">military coup</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_PBSuccess">operation PBSucess</a>. Arbenz threatened to nationalize the Rockefeller-owned United Fruit Company, in which CIA Director Allen Dulles also owns stock. Arbenz is replaced with a series of US-backed right-wing dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years, until 1996. The coup has been described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">1</a></li>
<li>In 1953, A 2011 release of British intelligence files revealed that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/26/mi5-files-coup-british-guiana">US and British MI5 forces overthrew the government of Cheddi Jagan</a>, the elected leader of British Guyana. They showed how British spies kept up intense scrutiny on Cheddi Jagan and his wife Janet, who together founded the People's Progressive party (PPP) to campaign for workers' rights and independence from British rule for the sugar-producing colony in northern South America. Churchill and the US feared that the Jagans were communists, although MI5 found no foreign ties. Churchill dispatched a warship, HMS Superb, and brought hundreds of troops by air and sea to secure key sites. An outraged Cheddi Jagan appealed by telegram to Britain's opposition Labour party for help. Leader Clement Attlee replied curtly: &quot;Regret impossible to intervene.&quot;</li>
<li>From 1945-54 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukbalahap_Rebellion">the US waged a war against the Hukbalahaps (&quot;Huks&quot;) in the Philippines</a>. The Huks were a leftist resistance army consisting largely of peasant farmers. On February 7, 1945, over 100 Huks were massacred and buried in a mass grave by the USAFFE guerrillas (U.S. Army Forces in the Far East). In the late spring and early summer of 1945, the USAFFE guerrillas had conductued a reign of terror against the Huks. Brutality and looting became the norm for anyone suspected of even a remote connection with the Huks. After the WW2, USAFFE was ordered to be demobilized and the US needed alternative instruments for enforcing its rule, so they started to support, train, and fund the Philippine army and officials. For example the Philippine Military Police was in direct control and supervision of the US Army. Between September 1945 and the beginning of May 1946, a conservative estimate placed the number of Huks killed at 660. Philippines managed to became independent on July 4, 1946, but little changed for the peasants, Huks were shelled indiscriminately; villagers were tortured and forcibly evacuated, their homes looted and burned. Just before the independency, on June 30, 1946, the US Army gave to the Philippine Army $100 million worth of arms, equipment and supplies. Between 1946 and 1946 Philipine government and landlords continued their reign of terror against the peasantry. In 1951 an Office of Psychological Warfare was set up and it was shortly after renamed to Civil Affairs Office (CAO). The CAO undertook a massive propaganda effort against the Huks. Within two years more than 13 million leaflets and other literature had been distrubuted, and over 6,000 mettings were held, reaching 1.5 million people. The CAO organized anticommunist forums in universities, patriotic writing contests were set up for high school and college students, and propaganda materials were distrubuted in the grammar schools. In the early 1950s, three major news-papers were American-owned. News of the world outside the Philippines was largely filtered through American-owned wire services. Sixty percent of the films shown in the Philippines were imported from the US. The US also used other propaganda techniques, such as exploiting ethnic differences among Filipinos, covertly formenting mass demonstrations against the Huks etc. Between August 1, 1950, and June 30, 1952, the Philippine Air Force flew 2,600 bombing and strafing sorties, expending over 1 million rounds of .50 caliber ammunition and 250,000 pounds of explosives on Huk targets. At the end of 1951 the US provided napalm for the Philippine officials and it was used against suspected Huk concentrations. Although the Huks did not formally concede defeat until the mid-1950s, they were essentially beaten militarily and psychologically in the first few years of the decade. US policymakers had been willing to use American troops directly in the Philippines if necessary, but they welcomed not having to do so. &quot;Much of the stigma of colonialism can be removed,&quot; stated a high-level State and Defense Department mission to Southeast Asia, &quot;if, where necessary, yellow men will be killed by yellow men rather than by white men alone.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukbalahap_Rebellion">1</a>,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220311221232/https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceb5kcg2xl5lowyu2v6avzmorbpmwddqj54bu5gk6kowsjdnjaevjw?filename=Stephen+R.+Shalom+-+The+United+States+and+the+Philippines_+A+Study+of+Neocolonialism-Institute+for+the+Study+of+Human+Issues+%281981%29.pdf">2</a></li>

<li>In 1941, the US used its contacts in the Panama National Guard, which the U.S. had earlier trained, to have the government of Panama overthrown in a bloodless coup. The U.S. had requested that the government of Panama allow it to build over 130 new military installations inside and outside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal_Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>, and the government of Panama refused this request at the price suggested by the U.S.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler#The_Banana_Wars">Smedley Butler's</a> (A former US general and medal of honor recipient) 1935 pamphlet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket">War is a Racket</a>, he recounted his experience as being an agent of American Imperialism: “I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.”<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler#The_Banana_Wars">1</a></li>
<li>In 1928, the Columbian army killed ~800-3000 striking workers in Cienaga, Columbia, after the US threatened to invade with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> troops if the Colombian government did not act to protect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company">United Fruit Company</a>'s interests, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_massacre">Banana Massacre</a>. The banana plantation workers were demanding written contracts, eight-hour work days, six-day work weeks and the elimination of food coupons. The troops set up their machine guns on the roofs of the low buildings at the corners of the main square, closed off the access streets, and after a five-minute warning opened fire into a dense Sunday crowd of workers and their wives and children who had gathered, after Sunday Mass, to wait for an anticipated address from the governor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_massacre">1</a></li>
<li>From 1916-24, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_the_Dominican_Republic_(1916%E2%80%9324)">US occupied the Dominican Republic</a>, with repeated actions in 1903, 1904, and 1914. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_the_Dominican_Republic_(1916%E2%80%9324)">1</a></li>
<li>From 1915–34, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Haiti">Haiti was occupied by the US</a>, which led to the creation of a new Haitian constitution in 1917 that instituted changes that included an end to the prior ban on land ownership by non-Haitians. Including the First and Second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caco_Wars">Caco Wars</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#cite_note-13">13]</a> At least 15,000 Haitians were killed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Haiti">1</a></li>
<li>In 1914, the US military invaded Veracruz, Mexico, after US sailors were arrested by the Mexican government for entering off-limits areas, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico_Affair">Tampico Affair</a>. Over 200 were killed in the invasion.</li>
<li>In 1912, the US military invaded Nicaragua after intermittent landings and naval bombardments in the previous decades. It was occupied by the U.S. almost continuously from 1912 through 1933. With the onset of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">Great Depression</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_C._Sandino">Augusto C.

<li>In 1906, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cananea_strike">5360 Mexican workers went on strike</a> at the Cananea Copper Company mines in Cananea, Sonora. The company was owned and founded by American businessman William Greene, and received generous subsidies and contracts from then dictator of Mexico Porfirio Diaz. Cananea was a company mining town where the only goods accessible were sold by the company and the prices were hefty relative to the wages earned. Mexican workers earned 3.5 pesos a day while American workers earned 5 pesos a day. The Mexican workers began a strike with the support of the surrounding population while the American workers defended the factory and the management. The American employees hosed high-pressure water and shot the crowd killing three people inciting riots that would later be squashed by Mexican soldiers. Although Diaz would reject American involvement, a trainload of Arizona Rangers had already crossed the border. All conspirators were given 15 years in prison but would be released in the course of the Mexican Revolution.</li>
<li>In 1903 the US backed its puppet state <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_Panama_from_Colombia">Panama's secession from Columbia</a>, for Columbia's refusal to allow the US military presence there. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal">Panama Canal</a> was under construction by then, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal_Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>, under United States sovereignty, was then created, and under control by the US military for 100 years, until 2000.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_Panama_from_Colombia">1</a></li>
<li>From 1895-1917, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Wars">Banana Wars</a> refers to the military intervention on behalf of US business interests in Central America and the Caribbean (8 countries in total) after the Spanish American War.

<li>In 1896, the US fought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War">Spanish-American War</a> largely over economic interests in the Caribbean, primarily Cuba. Historian Eric Foner writes: &quot;Even before the Spanish flag was down in Cuba, U.S. business interests set out to make their influence felt. Merchants, real estate agents, stock speculators, reckless adventurers, and promoters of all kinds of get-rich schemes flocked to Cuba by the thousands. Seven syndicates battled each other for control of the franchises for the Havana Street Railway, which were finally won by Percival Farquhar, representing the Wall Street interests of New York. Thus, simultaneously with the military occupation began . . . commercial occupation.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War">1</a></li>
<li>In 1846, the US sent a small force into Mexico with the aim of bringing about a war, and started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War">Mexican-American War</a>. The US prevailed, expanding its territory far into Mexico, and killed ~25,000 mexicans in the process, as part of an ideological goal of white supremacy in north america called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny">manifest destiny</a>. The shift in the Mexico-U.S. border left many Mexican citizens separated from their national government.

It was the largest pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, producing medicine both for human and veterinary use.

It was the only pharmaceutical factory in Africa not under US control. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shifa_pharmaceutical_factory">1</a></li>
<li>In June 1982, with the help of CIA money and arms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiss%C3%A8ne_Habr%C3%A9#Support_of_the_U.S._and_France">Hissene Habre</a> , dubbed Africa's Pinochet, takes power in Chad. His secret police, use methods of torture including the burning the body of the detainee with incandescent objects, spraying gas into their eyes, ears and nose, forced swallowing of water, and forcing the mouths of detainees around the exhaust pipes of running cars. Habré's government also periodically engaged in ethnic cleansing against groups such as the Sara, Hadjerai and the Zaghawa, killing and arresting group members en masse when it was perceived that their leaders posed a threat to the regime. Human Rights Watch claimed that Habre was responsible for thousands of killings. In 2001, while living in Senegal, he was almost tried for crimes committed by him in Chad. However, a court there blocked these proceedings. Then human rights people decided to pursue the case in Belgium, because some of Habre’s torture victims lived there. The U.S., in June 2003, told Belgium that it risked losing its status as host to NATO’s headquarters if it allowed such a legal proceeding to happen. So the result was that the law that allowed victims to file complaints in Belgium for atrocities committed abroad was repealed. However, two months later a new law was passed which made special provision for the continuation of the case against Habre. In May 2016 he was found guilty of human-rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiss%C3%A8ne_Habr%C3%A9#Support_of_the_U.S._and_France">1</a></li>

US Representatives stated: “When we can appear in the Ports of the various Powers, or on the Coast, of Barbary, with Ships of such force as to convince those nations that We are able to protect our trade, and to compel them if necessary to keep faith with Us, then, and not before, We may probably secure a large share of the Meditn trade, which would largely and speedily compensate the U. S. for the Cost of a maritime force amply sufficient to keep all those Pirates in Awe, and also make it their interest to keep faith.” Thomas Jefferson echoed and carried out the war, saying that war was essential to securing markets along the Barbary Coast.</li>

Rather than creating new enterprises, Yeltsin's democratization led to international monopolies hijacking the former Soviet markets, arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market. Much of the Yeltsin era was marked by widespread corruption, and as a result of persistent low oil and commodity prices during the 1990s, Russia suffered inflation, economic collapse and enormous political and social problems that affected Russia and the other former states of the USSR.

<li>In December 1975, The US supplied the weaponry for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor">Indonesian invasion of East Timor</a>. This incursion was launched the day after U.S. President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had left Indonesia where they had given President Suharto permission to use American arms, which under U.S. law, could not be used for aggression. Daniel Moynihan, U.S. ambassador to the UN. said that the U.S. wanted “things to turn out as they did.” The result was an estimated 200,000 dead out of a population of 700,000. Sixteen years later, on November 12, 1991, two hundred and seventeen East Timorese protesters in Dili, many of them children, marching from a memorial service, were gunned down by Indonesian Kopassus shock troops who were headed by U.S.- trained commanders Prabowo Subianto (son in law of General Suharto) and Kiki Syahnakri.

In the late 50s, the CIA even creates an &quot;Armee Clandestine&quot; of Asian mercenaries to attack the Pathet Lao. After the CIA’s army suffers numerous defeats, the U.S. drops more bombs on Laos than all the U.S. bombs dropped in World War II. A quarter of all Laotians will eventually become refugees, many living in caves. This was later called a “secret war,” since it occurred at the same time as the Vietnam War, but got little press. Hundreds of thousands were killed.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War">1</a></li>
<li>In 1955, the CIA provided explosives, and aided KMT agents in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Princess">assassination attempt</a> against the Chinese Premier, Zhou Enlai. KMT agents placed a time-bomb on the Air India aircraft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Princess">Kashmir Princess</a>, which Zhou was supposed to take on his way to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung_Conference">Bandung Conference</a>, an anti-imperialist meeting of Asian and African states, but he changed his travel plans at the last minute.

<li>From 1955-1975, the US supported French colonialist interests in Vietnam, set up a puppet regime in Saigon to serve US interests, and later took part as a belligerent against North Vietnam in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a>. U.S. involvement escalated further following the 1964 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident">Gulf of Tonkin incident</a>, which was later found to be staged by Lyndon Johnson. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War_casualties">Vietnam War casualties</a>).

For four decades the South Korean government concealed this massacre. Survivors were forbidden by the government from revealing it, under suspicion of being communist sympathizers. Public revelation carried with it the threat of torture and death. During the 1990s and onwards, several corpses were excavated from mass graves, resulting in public awareness of the massacre. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodo_League_massacre">1</a></li>
<li>In 1984, documents were released showing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/08/world/us-papers-tell-of-53-policy-to-use-a-bomb-in-korea.html">Eisenhower authorized the use of atomic weapons on North Korea</a>, should the communists renew the war in 1953. The 2,000 pages released show the high level of planning and the detail of discussion on possible use of these weapons, and Mr. Eisenhower's interest in overcoming reluctance to use them.</li>
<li>In the beginning of the Korean war, US Troops killed ~300 South Korean civilians in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Gun_Ri_massacre">No Gun Ri massacre</a>, revealing a theater-wide policy of firing on approaching refugee groups. Trapped refugees began piling up bodies as barricades and tried to dig into the ground to hide. Some managed to escape the first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. No apology has yet been issued. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Gun_Ri_massacre#Killings">1</a></li>
<li>The US intervened in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">1950-53 Korean Civil War</a>, on the side of the south Koreans, in a proxy war between the US and china for supremacy in East Asia. South Korea reported some 373,599 civilian and 137,899 military deaths, the US with 34,000 killed, and China with 114,000 killed.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War#cite_note-ROK_Web-16">16]</a> Overall, the U.S. dropped 635,000 tons of bombs—including 32,557 tons of napalm—on Korea, more than they did during the whole Pacific campaign of World War II.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War#cite_note-Walkom2010-307">305]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War#cite_note-japanfocus.org-308">306]</a> The US killed an estimated 1/3rd of the north Korean people during the war.

<li>From 1948-1949, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_uprising">Jeju uprising</a> was an insurgency taking place in the Korean province of Jeju island, followed by severe anticommunist suppression of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_South_Korea">South Korean Labor Party</a> in which 14-30,000 people were killed, or ~10% of the island's population. Though atrocities were committed by both sides, the methods used by the South Korean government to suppress the rebels were especially cruel. On one occasion, American soldiers discovered the bodies of 97 people including children, killed by government forces. On another, American soldiers caught government police forces carrying out an execution of 76 villagers, including women and children. The US later entered the Korean civil war on the side of the South Koreans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_uprising">1</a></li>
<li>In 1949 during the resumed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War">Chinese Civil War</a>, the US supported the corrupt Kuomintang dictatorship of Chiang Kaishek to fight against the Chinese Communists, who had won the support of the vast majority of peasant-farmers and helped defeat the Japanese invasion. The US strongly supported the Kuomintang forces. Over 50,000 US Marines were sent to guard strategic sites, and 100,000 US troops were sent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong">Shandong</a>. The US equipped and trained over 500,000 KMT troops, and transported KMT forces to occupy newly liberated zones as well as to contain Communist-controlled areas.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War#cite_note-nat-54">51]</a> American aid included substantial amounts of both new and surplus military supplies; additionally, loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars were made to the KMT.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War#cite_note-62">59]</a> Within less than two years after the Sino-Japanese War, the KMT had received $4.43 billion from the US—most of which was military aid.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War#cite_note-nat-54">51]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War#Resumed_fighting_.281946.E2.80.931950.29">1</a></li>
<li>The U.S. installed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee">Syngman Rhee</a>,a conservative Korean exile, as President of South Korea in 1948. Rhee became a dictator on an anti-communist crusade, arresting and torturing suspected communists, brutally putting down rebellions, killing 100,000 people and vowing to take over North Korea. Rhee precipitated the outbreak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">Korean War</a> and for the allied decision to invade North Korea once South Korea had been recaptured. He was finally forced to resign by mass student protests in 1960.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee">1</a></li>
<li>Between 1946 and 1958, the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_testing_at_Bikini_Atoll">tested 23 nuclear devices at Bikini Atoll, using the native islanders and their land as guinea pigs for the effects of nuclear fallout</a>. Significant fallout caused widespread radiological contamination in the area, and killed many islanders. A survivor stated, &quot;What the Americans did was no accident. They came here and destroyed our land. They came to test the effects of a nuclear bomb on us. It was no accident.&quot; Many of the islanders exposed were brought to the US Argonne National laboratory, to study the effects. Afterwards the islands proved unsuitable to sustaining life, resulting in starvation and requiring the residents to receive ongoing aid. Virtually all of the inhabitants showed acute symptoms of radiation syndrome, many developing thyroid cancers, Leukimia, miscarriages, stillborn and &quot;jellyfish babies&quot; (highly deformed) along with symptoms like hair falling out, and diahrrea. A handful were brought to the US for medical research and later returned, while others were evacuated to neighboring Islands. The US under LBJ prematurely returned the majority returned 3 years later, to further test how human beings absorb radiation from their food and environment. The islanders pleaded with the US to move them away from the islands, as it became clear that their children were developing deformities and radiation sickness. Radion levels were still unacceptable. The United States later paid the islanders and their descendants 25 million in compensation for damage caused by the nuclear testing program. A 2016 investigation found radiation levels on Bikini Atoll as high as 639 mrem yr−1, well above the established safety standard threshold for habitation of 100 mrem yr−1. Similar tests occurred elsewhere in the Marshall Islands during this time period. Due to the destruction of natural wealth, Kwajalein Atoll's military installation and dislocation, the <a href="http://hellomarshallislands.weebly.com/poverty.html">majority of natives currently live in extreme poverty</a>, making less than 1$ a day. Those that have jobs, mostly work at the US military installation and resorts. Much of this is detailed in the documentary, <a href="https://vimeo.com/277068625">The Coming War on China (2016)</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_testing_at_Bikini_Atoll">1</a>,<a href="http://hellomarshallislands.weebly.com/poverty.html">2</a></li>
<li>After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Douglas MacArthur pardoned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cover-up_of_Japanese_war_crimes">Unit 731</a>, a Japanese biological experimentation center which performed human testing of biological agents against Chinese citizens. While a series of war tribunals and trials was organized, many of the high-ranking officials and doctors who devised and respectively performed the experiments were pardoned and never brought to justice. As many as 12,000 people, most of them Chinese, died in Unit 731 alone and many more died in other facilities, such as Unit 100 and in field experiments throughout Manchuria. One of the experimenters who killed many, microbiologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shir%C5%8D_Ishii">Shiro Ishii</a>, later traveled to the US to advise on its bioweapons programs. In the final days of the Pacific War and in the face of imminent defeat, Japanese troops blew up the headquarters of Unit 731 in order to destroy evidence of the research done there. As part of the cover-up, Ishii ordered 150 remaining subjects killed.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cover-up_of_Japanese_war_crimes">1</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shir%C5%8D_Ishii">2</a></li>
<li>In 1945 during the month-long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_(1945)">Battle of Manila</a>, the US in deciding whether to attack Manila (then under Japanese occupation) with ground troops, decided instead to use indiscriminate carpet-bombing, howitzers, and naval bombardment, killing an estimated <a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/americans-destroyed-manila-1945">100,000 people.</a> The casualty figures show the US's regard for filipino civilian life: 1,010 Americans, 16,665 Japanese and 100,000 to 240,000 civilians were killed. Manila became, alongside Berlin, and Warsaw, one of the most devastated cities of WW2.</li>
<li>US Troops committed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Japan">number of rapes</a> during the battle of Okinawa, and the subsequent occupation of Japan. There were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture alone.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Japan">1</a> American Occupation authorities imposed wide-ranging censorship on the Japanese media, including bans on covering many sensitive social issues and serious crimes such as rape committed by members of the Occupation forces.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Japan#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDower1999412-32">2</a></li>
<li>From 1942 to 1945, the US military carried out a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan">fire-bombing campaign of Japanese cities</a>, killing between 200,000 and 900,000 civilians. One nighttime fire-bombing of Tokyo took 80,000 lives. During early August 1945, the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki">dropped atomic bombs</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, killing ~130,000 civilians, and causing radiation damage which included birth defects and a variety of genetic diseases for decades to come. The justification for the civilian bombings has largely been debunked, as the entrance of Russia into the war had already started the surrender negotiations earlier in 1945. The US was aware of this, since it had broken the Japanese code and had been intercepting messages during for most of the year. The US ended up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan">accepting a conditional surrender from Hirohito</a>, against which was one of the stated aims of the civilian bombings. The dropping of the atomic bomb is therefore seen as a demonstration of US military supremacy, and the first major operation of the Cold War with Russia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan">1</a>,<a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/">2</a></li>
<li>In 1918, the US took part in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War">allied intervention in the Russian civil war</a>, sending 11,000 troops to the in the Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok regions to support the anti-bolshevik, monarchist, and largely anti-semitic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_movement">White Forces</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War">1</a></li>
<li>In 1900 in China, the US was part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance">Eight-Nation Alliance</a> that brought 20,000 armed troops to China, to defeat the Imperial Chinese Army, in the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>, an anti-imperialist uprising. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion">1</a></li>
<li>In 1899, after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Revolution">popular revolution</a> in the Philippines to oust the Spanish imperialists, the US invaded and began the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War">Phillipine-American war</a>. The US military committed countless atrocities, leaving 200,000 Filipinos dead. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_H._Smith">Jacob H Smith</a> killed between 2,500 to 50,000 civilians, His orders included, &quot;kill everyone over the age of ten&quot; and make the island &quot;a howling wilderness.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War">1</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_H._Smith">2</a></li>
<li>Throughout the 1800s, <a href="https://wanderwisdom.com/travel-destinations/Hawaii-and-Native-Hawaiians-What-You-May-Not-Know">US settlers engaged in a genocide of native Hawaiians.</a> The native population decreased from ~ 400k in 1789, to 40k by 1900, due to colonization and disease. In 1883, the US engineered the overthrow of Hawaii's native monarch, Queen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liliuokalani">Lili'uokalani</a>, by landing two companies of US marines in Honolulu. Due to the Queen's desire &quot;to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life&quot; for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. Hawaii was initially reconstituted as an independent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic">republic</a>, but the ultimate goal of the US was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which was finally accomplished in 1898. After this, the Hawaiian language was banned, English replaced it as the official language in all institutions and schools. The US finally apologized in 1993, but no land has been returned. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hawaii">1</a></li>

<li>In late 2019, <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/18/assange-us-extradite-cia-killed-british-teen/#more-20969">CIA agent Anne Sacoolas hit and killed a British teenage pedestrian named Harry Dunn with her car</a>, while she was driving on the wrong side of the road, near the RAF Croughton base in the UK where she and her husband (both CIA agents) worked. After the Foreign and Commonwealth office rejected Anne Sacoolas request for diplomatic immunity, Anne fled the UK on a US Air Force plane. Both the US and UK governments lied to the Dunn family, saying that she was a US diplomat, and hid the fact that she had fled for months. In October, the Dunn family visited the White House and met with Donald Trump. According to Seiger, Trump tried to buy off the couple, promising them that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was “standing by ready to write a check.” Trump reportedly blindsided the Dunns, telling them that Sacoolas was in the other room waiting to meet with them. The couple refused the offer, demanding her extradition. Sacoolas's lawyers have stated, “Anne will not return voluntarily to the United Kingdom to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident.” As of February 2020, the extradition request is at an impasse, while at the same time the UK is complying with Julian Assange's extradition to the US. RAF Croughton base houses agents from the NSA and CIA, and is famous for being exposed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for forwarding information from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone to the CIA. On march 2021, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36C3gmE3fWY">US admitted that sacoolas was a CIA agent.</a></li>
<li>In 2003, the CIA kidnapped Italian milanese Imam Abu Omar, took him to Egypt, then tortured, including rape, genital electro-shock, and resulted in him becoming deaf in one ear, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam_Rapito_affair">Imam Rapito Affair.</a> On 23 December 2005, a judge issued a European arrest warrant against 22 CIA agents, but the US hasn't responded.</li>

<li>From March to June of 1999, After Serbs refused to acquiesce in the break-up of their republic, the US and NATO began <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia">bombing Yugoslavia</a> killing ~500 civilians, leaving thousands homeless, destroying bridges, industrial plants, public buildings, private businesses, as well as barracks and military installations. <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/11/18/breaking-yugoslavia-how-the-us-used-nato-as-its-battering-ram/">1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia">2</a></li>
<li>In February, 1998, A US marine core plane flying wrecklessly below regulations, cut a cable supporting aerial cable cars at a ski resort near Cavalese, Italy, killing 20 people, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalese_cable_car_disaster_(1998)">Cavalese Cable Car Disaster / Massacre of Cermis.</a> The pilots destroyed the plane's tape, and were found not guilty. Italian prosecutors were outraged that the US refused to forgoe the NATO treaty that gives all jurisduction to US military courts. By February 1999, the victims' families had received USD $65,000 per victim as immediate help by the Italian government, which was reimbursed by the U.S. government. In May 1999, the U.S. Congress rejected a bill that would have set up a $40 million compensation fund for the victims. In December 1999, the Italian legislature approved a monetary compensation plan for the families ($1.9 million per victim). NATO treaties obligated the U.S. government to pay 75% of this compensation, which it did.</li>
<li>In 1995, the US conducted a campaign of airstrikes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Deliberate_Force">Operation Deliberate Force</a>, as part of an intervention in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War">Bosnian civil war</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Deliberate_Force">1</a></li>
<li>From the 1950s-90s, the CIA and NATO ran a series of clandestine networks, headquartered in Rome, Italy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">Operation Gladio.</a> Its purpose was supplying aid (primarily money and weaponry) to right wing paramilitaries to attack left-wing movements, and carry out assassinations and bombings, as well as funnel money to centrist political parties. It had operations in Belgium, Finland, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Austria. In Italy, the group had 600+ members, and carried out car bombings during Italy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead">years of lead.</a> In Germany, it included former Nazi SS members—Staff Sgt.

These include stirring up ethnic tensions between the member countries, economic warfare, and military intervention. The Reagan administration in a 1982 secret memo, advocated &quot;expanded efforts to promote a 'quiet revolution' to overthrow Communist governments and parties,&quot; while reintegrating the countries of Eastern Europe into a market-oriented economy.

<li>Ben Urwand revealed how the Nazis’ man in Hollywood Georg Gyssling censored and rewrote film scripts to remove scenes and dialogue that criticised the Nazi regime. He also repeatedly removed references to the suffering of Jews in post-WW1 Germany. The DOD continued this policy after the war, helping rehabilitate Germany’s image and cover up for anti-semitism. Before 1939, Los Angeles authorities were impeding antifascist Jewish groups while letting Fascists in Hollywood run amok. <a href="https://www.spyculture.com/?p=7400">1</a></li>
<li>In 1926, the House of Representatives and Senate, at the request of Fascist Italy, voted to forgive 80.4% Italy's WWI war debt. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fxqzCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT229">1</a></li>
<li>The US maintained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_Acts_of_1930s">a policy of neutrality during the rise of Hitler and Mussolini</a>, discounting the rise of anti-semitism and European fascism. It was not Hitler's attacks on the Jews that brought the United States into World War II, any more than the enslavement of 4 million blacks brought Civil War in 1861. Italy's attack on Ethiopia, Hitler's invasion of Austria, his takeover of Czechoslovakia, his attack on Poland-none of those events caused the United States to enter the war, although Roosevelt did begin to give important aid to England. What brought the United States fully into the war was the Japanese attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_Acts_of_1930s">1</a></li>
<li>In the 1936-39 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War">Spanish civil war</a>, the Roosevelt administration sponsored a neutrality act that had the effect of shutting off help to the Spanish government while Hitler and Mussolini gave critical aid to Franco, aiding yet another fascist victory in Europe.

<li>In 2016, the US army corp of engineers approved a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Transfer_Partners">Energy Transfer Partners</a>' proposal to build an oil pipeline near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Rock_Indian_Reservation">Standing Rock Indian Reservation</a>, sparking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests">Dakota Access Pipeline Protests</a>, evoking a brutal response from North Dakota police aided by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_the_United_States">National Guard</a>, private security firms, and other law enforcement agencies from surrounding states. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe believes that the pipeline would put the Missouri River, the water source for the reservation, at risk, pointing out two recent spills, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo_River_oil_spill">a 2010 pipeline spill into the Kalamazoo River</a> in Michigan, which cost over billion to clean up with significant contamination remaining, and a 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Yellowstone_River_oil_spill">Bakken crude oil spill into the Yellowstone River</a> in Montana. Police repression has included dogs attacking protesters, spraying water cannons on protesters in sub-freezing temperatures, &gt;700 arrests of Native Americans and ~200 injuries, a highly militarized police force using armored personnel carriers, concussion grenades, mace, Tasers, batons, rubber bullets, and tear gas. In November 2017, the keystone XL pipeline burst, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/us/keystone-pipeline-leak/">spilling 210,000 gallons of oil</a> in Amherst, South Dakota. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/us/keystone-pipeline-leak/">2</a></li>
<li>In 1975, FBI agents attacked AIM activists on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation#The_Pine_Ridge_Shootout">Pine Ridge Reservation</a>, in the 'Pine Ridge Shootout'.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation#cite_note-TimeShootout-37">37]</a> Two FBI agents, and an AIM activist were killed. In two separate trials, the U.S. prosecuted participants in the firefight for the deaths of the agents. AIM members <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Robideau">Robert Robideau</a> and Dino Butler were acquitted after asserting that they had acted in self–defense. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Peltier">Leonard Peltier</a> was extradited from Canada and tried separately because of the delay. He was convicted on two counts of first–degree murder for the deaths of the FBI agents[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation#cite_note-LeonardPeltierTrial-38">38]</a> and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life in prison, after a trial which is still contentious. He remains in prison.</li>
<li>In 1973, 200 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oglala_Lakota">Oglala Lakota</a> and AIM activists occupied the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Reservation, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_incident">Wounded knee incident</a>. They were protesting the reservation's corrupt US-backed tribal chairman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Wilson_(tribal_chairman)">Dick Wilson</a>, who controlled a private militia, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Oglala_Nation">Guardians of the Oglala Nation</a> (GOONs), funded by the government. FBI, US marshals, and other law enforcement cordoned off the area and attacked the activists with armored vehicles, automatic rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, and gas shells, resulting in two killed and 13 wounded. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Ray_Robinson">Ray Robinson</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights">civil rights</a> activist who joined the protesters, disappeared during the events and is believed to have been murdered. As food supplies became short, three planes dropped 1,200 pounds of food, but as people scrambled to gather it up, a government helicopter appeared overhead and fired down on them while groundfire came from all sides. After the siege ended in a truce, 120 occupiers were arrested. Wilson stayed in office and in 1974 was re-elected amid charges of intimidation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud">voter fraud</a>, and other abuses. The rate of violence climbed on the reservation as conflict opened between political factions in the following three years; residents accused Wilson's private militia of much of it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_incident">1</a></li>
<li>In Nov. 1969, a group of 89 Native Americans occupied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Alcatraz">Alcatraz Island</a> for 15 months, to gauge the US's commitment to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Laramie_%281868%29">Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)</a>, which stated that all abandoned federal land must be returned to native people. Eventually the government cut off all electrical power and all telephone service to the island. In June, a fire of disputed origin destroyed numerous buildings on the island.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Alcatraz#cite_note-occupation-7">7]</a> Left without power, fresh water, and in the face of diminishing public support and sympathy, the number of occupiers began to dwindle. On June 11, 1971, a large force of government officers removed the remaining 15 people from the island.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Alcatraz">1</a></li>
<li>From its creation in 1968, The <strong>American Indian Movement</strong> (<strong>AIM</strong>) has been a target of repression from law enforcement agencies, and surveillance as one of the FBI's COINTELPRO targets. This includes the wounded knee incident and the pine ridge shootout. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Movement">1</a></li>
<li>In 1942 the federal government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Takings_clause">took</a> privately held Pine Ridge Indian Reservation land owned by tribal members in order to establish the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_Bombing_Range">Badlands Bombing Range</a> of 341,725 acres, evicting 125 families. Among the families evicted was that of Pat Cuny, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oglala_Sioux">Oglala Sioux</a>. He fought in World War II in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a> after surviving torpedoing of his transport in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel">English Channel</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation#cite_note-24">24]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Beard">Dewey Beard</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniconjou">Miniconjou</a> Sioux survivor of the Wounded Knee Massacre, who supported himself by raising horses on his 908-acre allotment received in 1907 was also evicted. The small federal payments were insufficient to enable such persons to buy new properties. In 1955 the 97-year-old Beard testified of earlier mistreatment at Congressional hearings about this project.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation#cite_note-25">25]</a> He said, for &quot;fifty years I have been kicked around. Today there is a hard winter coming. ...I might starve to death.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation#Taking_of_Badlands_Bombing_Range">1</a></li>
<li>In 1890, US soldiers killed 150-300 people (including 65 women and 24 children) at Wounded Knee (19-26 people, including two women and eleven children.) on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people">Lakota</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation">Pine Ridge Indian Reservation</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota">South Dakota</a>. Twenty-five soldiers also died, and 39 were wounded (6 of the wounded later died).[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre#cite_note-7">7]</a> At least twenty soldiers were awarded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. The event was driven by local racism towards the practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Dance">Ghost Dancing</a>, which whites found distasteful, and the Native Americans arming up in response to repeated broken treaties, stolen land, and their bison-herds being hunted to near extinction by the whites.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre">1</a></li>
<li>In 1887, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Act">Dawes Act</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Act_of_1898">Curtis Act</a>, resulted in the loss of 90 million acres of native-alloted land, and the abolition of many native governments. During the ensuing decades, the Five Civilized Tribes lost 90 million acres of former communal lands, which were sold to non-Natives. In addition, many individuals, unfamiliar with land ownership, became the target of speculators and criminals, were stuck with allotments that were too small for profitable farming, and lost their household lands. Tribe members also suffered from the breakdown of the social structure of the tribes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Act">1</a></li>
<li>Starting in the 1870s, The US army, aided by settlers and private hunters, began a widespread policy of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/05/the-buffalo-killers/482349/">slaughtering bufallo and bison</a>, in order to destroy many tribe's primary food source, and to starve Native Americans into submission. By 1900, they succeeded; the bufallo population dropped from more than 30 million, to a few hundred. The country’s highest generals, politicians, and presidents including Ulysses S. Grant, saw the destruction of buffalo as solution to the country’s “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40168089?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Indian Problem</a>.” By destroying the food supply of the plains natives, they could more easily move them onto reservations.<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/05/the-buffalo-killers/482349/">1</a></li>
<li>Starting in 1830-50, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears">Trail of Tears</a> was a series of forced removals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native American</a> nations, including Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole, Cherokee people and the African freedmen and slaves who lived among
them, from their ancestral homelands in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States">Southeastern United States</a> to an area west of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River">Mississippi River</a> that had been designated as Native Territory. The forced relocations were carried out by various government authorities following the passage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act">Indian Removal Act</a> in 1830. &quot;Marshaled by guards, hustled by agents, harried by contractors,they were being herded on the way to an unknown and unwelcome destination like a flock of sick sheep.&quot; They went on ox wagons, on horses, on foot, then to be ferried across the MississippiRiver. The army was supposed to organize their trek, but it turned over its job to private contractors who charged the government as much as possible, gave the Indians as little as possible. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_removal">Cherokee removal</a> in 1838 (the last forced removal east of the Mississippi) was brought on by the discovery of gold near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahlonega,_Georgia">Dahlonega, Georgia</a> in 1828, resulting in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Gold_Rush">Georgia Gold Rush</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears#cite_note-6">6]</a> Approximately 2,000-6,000 of the 16,543 relocated Cherokee perished along the way.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears#cite_note-7">7]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears#cite_note-8">8]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears#cite_note-9">9]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears#cite_note-10">10]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears#cite_note-books.google.com-11">11]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears">1</a></li>
<li>In 1848, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Genocide">California Genocide</a> is a term used to describe the drastic decrease in Native American population in California.

<li>In 1832, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War">Black Hawk War</a>, was a brief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1832_in_the_United_States">1832</a> conflict between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native Americans</a> led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_%28Sauk_leader%29">Black Hawk</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauk_people">Sauk</a> leader, in Illinois. The war gave impetus to the US policy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal">Indian removal</a>, in which Native American tribes were pressured to sell their lands and move west of the Mississippi River and stay there. Over 500 Native Americans were killed in the conflict.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War">1</a></li>
<li>In 1832, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickasaw">Chickasaw Indians</a> were forced by the US to sell their country in 1832 and move to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Territory">Indian Territory</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>) during the era of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal">Indian Removal</a> in the 1830s.</li>
<li>In 1813, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War">Creek War</a>, was a war between the US, lead by the then notorious indian-hunter Andrew Jackson, and the Creek nation, residing primarily in Alabama. Over 1,500 creeks were killed. The war effectively ended with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Jackson" title="August 1814">Treaty of Fort Jackson</a>, where General Andrew Jackson insisted that the Creek confederacy cede more than 21 million acres of land from southern Georgia and central Alabama. These lands were taken from allied Creek as well as Red Sticks. In 1814, Andrew Jackson became famous for his role in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Horseshoe_Bend_(1814)">Battle of Horseshoe Bend</a>, where his side killed more than 800 Creeks. Under Jackson, and the man he chose to succeed him, Martin Van Buren, 70,000 Indians east of the Mississippi were forced westward.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars">Indian Wars</a> is a name given to the collection of over 40 conflicts and wars between Native Americans and US settlers. The US census bureau reports that they have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians.

<li>In 1991 in Los Angeles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Latasha_Harlins">Latasha Harlins</a> was a 15-year-old black teen who was shot in the head by Soon Ja Du, a 51-year-old female store owner from South Korea, who was tried and convicted of voluntary manslaughter in Harlins' death. Harlins' death came 13 days after the videotaped beating of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King">Rodney King</a>. Du was fined $500 and sentenced to five years of probation and 400 hours of community service but <strong>no prison time for her crime</strong>. Some cited the shooting as one of the causes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots">1992 Los Angeles riots</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Latasha_Harlins">1</a></li>
<li>In 1991, Los Angeles police beat up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King#Incident">Rodney King</a>, a black taxi-driver, and his two passengers, after he refused to pull over. The brutal beating, in which he was gagged, tazed, kicked, and beaten with batons by around 6 cops, with ~15 more idly watching, was caught on video, and the media frenzy and black community reaction surrounding his beating lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots">1992 Los Angeles riots</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King#Incident">1</a></li>
<li>On May 13, 1985, the police again attempted to evict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE">MOVE</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE#1985_bombing">and bombed an entire city block</a>, killing 11 people (including 5 children, Delisha, Thee, Netta, Frank, Raymond, Vincent, Conrad, Rhonda, Lil Phil, Thomaso, &amp; Theresa Africa), and leaving 250 homeless. Police initially lobbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas">tear gas</a> canisters at the building, and a gunfight with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_firearm">semi-automatic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_firearm">automatic firearms</a> ensued. Commissioner Sambor then ordered a bombing from a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Police_Department">Philadelphia Police Department</a> Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound bombs made of C4 explosive (which the police referred to as &quot;entry devices&quot;) made of FBI-supplied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_gel_explosive">water gel explosive</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite">dynamite</a> substitute, targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house. The resulting explosions ignited a fire from fuel for a gasoline-powered generator in rooftop bunker that eventually destroyed approximately 65 nearby houses. The firefighters, who had earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cannon#Riot_control">deluge-hosed</a> the MOVE members in a failed attempt to evict them from the building, stood by as the fire caused by the bomb engulfed the first house and spread to others, having been given orders to let the fire burn. Despite the earlier drenching of the building by firefighters, officials said that they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters. Eleven people (John Africa, five other adults and five children aged 7 to 13) died in the resulting fire. Ramona Africa, one of the two survivors, stated that police fired at those trying to escape. No one from the city government was charged criminally. Many MOVE members are still in prison, fighting for their release. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE#1985_bombing">1</a></li>
<li>In 1982, an <a href="https://owd.tcnj.edu/~kpearson/Mumia/part5.htm">all‐white jury in Philadelphia sentenced Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal to death</a> for <a href="https://owd.tcnj.edu/~kpearson/Mumia/parrt4.htm">supposedly murdering a police officer.</a> Tellingly, <a href="http://www.mumia.de/doc/aktuell/20010903mde02en.html">one of the judges referred to Abu‐Jamal with a racial slur.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumia_Abu-Jamal">2</a></li>
<li>In 1979, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Workers%27_Party_(United_States)">communist-led march</a> to oust the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Nazi_Party">American Nazi Party</a> lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_massacre">Greensboro Massacre</a>, where local police helped the KKK stop the march and kill 5 protesters. Edward Dawson, a Klansman-turned FBI informant as part of the agency's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> program and was among the founders of the North Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan when the North Carolina chapter of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Klans_of_America">United Klans of America</a> split. By 1979 he was working as an informant for the Greensboro Police Department. He was given a copy of the march route from the police and informed them of the potential for violence. Absent the police, the attackers escaped with relative ease. All of the killers were acquitted in state and national trials. The city lost a civil lawsuit in 1980, being one of the few times in US history when &quot;a jury held local police liable for cooperating with the KKK in a wrongful death.&quot; The Greensboro city council finally apologized for the incident in 2017. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_massacre">1</a></li>
<li>In 1979, Los Angeles police shot and killed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Eulia_Love">Eulia Love</a> over a disputed gas bill. LA police had a notorious reputation for using violence in black, brown, and gay communities. The police chief in a press conference later corrected the amount of the bill, after a reporter quoted an incorrect amount for the bill. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Eulia_Love">1</a>&gt;</li>
<li>In 1978, the police were involved in shootout with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE">MOVE</a>, a black power commune in Philadelphia, after attempting to evict them. The 9 surviving members (called the MOVE 9, including Charles Sims Africa) were given 100 year long sentences, 7 of which are still currently in prison.</li>
<li>Between 1932 and 1972, the US public health service secretly infected ~200 black men with syphilis, under the guise of receiving free health care, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">Tuskegee syphilis experiment</a>. None of the men infected were ever told they had the disease (told instead they had &quot;bad blood&quot;), and none were treated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin">penicillin</a> even after the antibiotic became proven for the treatment of syphilis in 1947. By the end of the study in 1972, only 74 of the test subjects were alive. Of the original 399 men, 28 had died of syphilis, 100 were dead of related complications, 40 of their wives had been infected, and 19 of their children were born with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_syphilis">congenital syphilis</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">1</a></li>
<li>Between the 1950s and the 1970s, predatory contracts called &quot;home sale contracts&quot; were given to 75% of the 60k homes purchased by black Chicaogans. These &quot;home sale contracts&quot; allowed the seller to hold the property until the buyer paid off the entire mortgage. This meant that no equity was accrued by the buyer and the owners could kick the buyers out if a single monthly payment was missed. Black contract buyers in Chicago payed an average of $71k more than they would have through a conventional non-predatory mortgage. In total, between $3.2B and $4B were <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/5/30/18644165/chicago-redlining-racism-real-estate-contract-rent-mortgages-black-homeownership-racial-wealth-gap">expropriated from Chicago's black community</a>.</li>
<li>In 1969, the FBI in collaboration with chicago police, murdered an influential black panther organizer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton#1969_raid_and_assassination">Fred Hampton</a>, when he was 21 years old. An FBI informant drugged him in the evening, then agents broke into the apartment, killing another, and firing into the room where Hampton and his pregnant girlfriend slept. The FBI targeted him as being a potential &quot;Black Messiah&quot;, as Hampton was organizing poor blacks, whites, Latinos, and Native Americans in Chicago with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Coalition_(Fred_Hampton)">Rainbow Coalition</a>, to fight the repressive police brutality under mayor Daley. After a break-in at an FBI office in Pennsylvania, the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>, an illegal counter-intelligence program, was brought to light. One of the documents that was released after the break-in was a floor plan of Hampton's apartment. Another document outlined a deal the FBI brokered with the deputy attorney general to conceal the FBI's role in the assassination of Hampton and the existence of COINTELPRO. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton#1969_raid_and_assassination">1</a></li>
<li>Starting in 1967, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party">Black Panther Party</a>, a revolutionary black socialist group, became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party#COINTELPRO">target of FBI's COINTELPRO</a>. Hoover deemed the Panther's free breakfast program (which served food for 10,000 children daily at its height), and its free medical care programs, as a dangerous threat to the US. Local police forces, aided by the FBI, were involved with multiple break-ins of panther headquarters, shoot-outs, the arrests, imprisonment, or murder of nearly every high-ranking member, and achieved its systematic destruction by 1980. A faithful account of its history is in founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_p_newton">Huey P. Newton's</a> autobiography <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Suicide">Revolutionary Suicide</a>, and the history <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-against-Empire-Politics-Foundation/dp/0520293282/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485890722&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=black+against+empire">Black against Empire</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party">1</a></li>
<li>In 1967, a nationwide series of riots broke out in the black ghettos of the US, involving young blacks revolting against the white-supremacist power structure. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Detroit_riot">1967 Detroit Riot</a>, Lyndon Johnson brought in the Michigan National guard to put down the revolt. The result was 43 dead, 1,189 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Detroit_riot">1</a></li>
<li>From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the FBI to 'neutralize' him as an effective civil rights leader. This included wiretapping his phones, blackmail letters threatening to expose his extramarital affairs, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93King_suicide_letter">letter encouraging him to commit suicide</a>, as well as watching King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.#Allegations_of_conspiracy">during his assassination</a>, leading many to believe the FBI were either complicit, or accomplices. The FBI are similarly accused of being complicit or accomplices to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X#Allegations_of_conspiracy">nation of Islam's murder of Malcolm X.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.#FBI_and_King.27s_personal_life">1</a> In February 2021, a deathbed confession from an NYPD agent revealed that the NYPD and FBI aided in the killing of Malcolm X, by <a href="https://twitter.com/MXGMNational/status/1363283493078372352?s=20">arresting Malcolm X's bodyguards days before his assassination.</a></li>
<li>In such cities as Birmingham, Alabama, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_campaign#Conflict_escalation">police ruthlessly enforced segregation</a>, and white supremacist terrorism. In 1963, the police assisted the KKK in bombing the black leaders of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_campaign">Birmingham Campaign for desegregation</a>, leading to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_riot_of_1963">Birmingham Riot of 1963</a>, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing">16th st. Baptist Church Bombing</a>, where 4 black girls were killed. The US government sent in troops to quell the revolting black populace. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Crusade_(1963)">1963 Children's Crusade</a>, police mass arrested black children who had walked out of school protesting segregation, using fire hoses and attack dogs against them. Over 1,000 people were arrested throughout the campaign.</li>
<li>In 1927, the US had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey">Marcus Garvey</a>, a black organizer, deported under false pretenses of mail fraud. Garvey was unique in advancing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-African_philosophy">Pan-African philosophy</a> to inspire a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_movement">mass movement</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_empowerment">economic empowerment</a> focusing on Africa known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garveyism">Garveyism</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey#cite_note-BackToAfrica-3">3]</a> Promoted by the UNIA as a movement of <em>African Redemption</em>, Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam">Nation of Islam</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari_movement">Rastafari movement</a> (some sects of which proclaim Garvey as a prophet.)[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey#cite_note-4">4]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey">1</a></li>
<li>In 1921, a white mob started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot">Tulsa race riot</a>, attacking black residents in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa">Tulsa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, in what is considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US History. Thousands of whites rampaged through the black community for two days, killing men and women, burning and looting stores and homes, and using private planes to drop burning balls of turpentine on rooftops. ~300 blacks were killed, and ~10,000 blacks were left homeless. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and more than 6,000 black residents were arrested and detained. In 2001 it was revealed that the police and national guard assisted the whites. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot">1</a></li>
<li>In the years between 1889 and 1903, on the average, every week, two Negroes were lynched by mobs -- hanged, burned, mutilated.</li>
<li>In 1887, white paramilitaries attacked and killed between 35-300 black <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Labor">Knights of Labor</a> sugar workers on strike for better conditions, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thibodaux_massacre">Thibodaux Massacre</a>. Victims reportedly included elders, women and children. All those killed were African American.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thibodaux_massacre#cite_note-Rebecca_Jarvis_Scott_page_85-3">3]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thibodaux_massacre">1</a></li>
<li>In the 1860s-70s, the Ku Klux Klan, aided by police, organized raids,lynchings, beatings, burnings, throughout the south. For Kentucky alone, between 1867 and 1871, the National Archives lists 116 acts of violence. A sample:
<ul>
<li>Sam Davis hung by a mob in Harrodsburg, May 28, 1868.</li>
<li>Wm. Pierce hung by a mob in Christian July 12, 1868.</li>
<li>Geo. Roger hung by a mob in Bradsfordville Martin County July 11, 1868. ...</li>
<li>Silas Woodford age sixty badly beaten by disguised mob. . ..</li>
<li>Negro killed by Ku Klux Klan in Hay county January 14, 1871.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the Civil war, black voting in the period after 1869 resulted in 2 black senators and 20 black congressmen. This list would dwindle rapidly after 1876, due to the reactionary policies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era#Johnson.27s_presidential_Reconstruction">Johnson-era reconstruction</a>, and the empowering of the KKK in the south. By 1901, there were no blacks in congress, and the number still hasn't returned to its 1869 levels.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_riots_of_1866">Memphis Riots of 1866</a> occurred after a shooting altercation between white policemen and black soldiers recently mustered out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army">Union Army</a>. Mobs of white civilians and policemen rampaged through black neighborhoods and the houses of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedmen">freedmen</a>, attacking and killing black men, women and children. 46 blacks and 2 whites were killed, 75 blacks injured, over 100 black persons robbed, 5 black women raped, and 91 homes, 4 churches and 8 schools burned in the black community.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_riots_of_1866#cite_note-Congress-2">2]</a>Modern estimates place property losses at over $100,000, suffered mostly by blacks. Police and firefighters made up one third of the mob (24% and 10%, respectively, of the total group); they were joined by small business owners (28%), clerks (10%), artisans (10%), and city officials (4.5%). Many blacks fled the city permanently; by 1870, their population had fallen by one quarter compared to 1865.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_riots_of_1866">1</a></li>
<li>In 1865-66, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_(United_States)">Black Codes</a> were laws passed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States">Southern states</a> after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">Civil War</a>. These laws had the intent and the effect of restricting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American">African Americans</a>' freedom, and of compelling them to work in a labor economy based on low wages or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_bondage">debt</a>. Black Codes were part of a larger pattern of Southern whites trying to suppress the new freedom of emancipated African American slaves, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedmen">freedmen</a>.</li>
<li>In 1865, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">13th Amendment</a>, abolished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States">slavery</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_servitude">involuntary servitude</a>, except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States">as punishment for a crime</a>. This would become an important loophole, as white supremacists, land-owners, and business-owners in the south would enact legislation and find ways to imprison blacks for petty crimes, and thus be able to use free prison labor for their businesses. This continues up to the present day, in such policies as the disparity of sentencing between prescription &quot;white&quot; drugs, and drugs typically used in poorer black communities.</li>
<li>In 1859, white <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States">abolitionist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a> attempted to begin an armed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_revolt">slave revolt</a>, rallying nearby black and white abolitionists, and raided an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown%27s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry">arsenal at Harpers Ferry</a>, Virginia. He intended to use the rifles and pikes he captured at the arsenal, in addition to those he brought along, to arm rebellious slaves with the aim of striking terror in the slaveholders in Virginia. He planned to send agents to nearby plantations, rallying the slaves. They would free more slaves, obtain food, horses and hostages, and destroy slaveholders' morale. Brown planned to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> south into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama">Alabama</a>, the heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States">South</a>, making forays into the plains on either side.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown%27s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry#cite_note-9">9]</a> Due primarily to intelligence leaks, the raid failed; 10 were killed and 6, including Brown, were captured (lead by future confederate general Robert E. Lee), then executed by hanging. Before his execution, John Brown addressed the court: ''I John Brown am now quite <em>certain</em> that the crimes of this <em>guilty, land: will</em> never be purged <em>away;</em> but with Blood. I had <em>as I now think: vainly</em> flattered myself that without <em>very much</em> bloodshed; it might be done. [...] Had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right; and every man in this court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown%27s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry">1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850">The Fugitive Slave act of 1850</a> was a law that required all escaped slaves, upon capture, to be returned to their masters and that officials and citizens of free states had to cooperate in this law.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States">Abolitionists</a> nicknamed it the &quot;Bloodhound Law&quot; for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound">dogs</a> that were used to track down runaway slaves.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850#cite_note-Nevins-1">1]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850">1</a></li>
<li>In 1831, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_slave_rebellion">Nat Turner lead a Slave Rebellion</a> in Southampton County, Virginia. Rebel slaves killed from 55 to 65 white slave-owners, the highest number of any slave uprising in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States">Southern United States</a>. There was widespread fear in the aftermath of the rebellion, and white militias organized in retaliation against the slaves. The state executed 56 slaves accused of being part of the rebellion. In the frenzy, many non-participant slaves were punished. At least 100 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans">African Americans</a>, and possibly up to 200, were murdered by militias and mobs in the area. Blacks suspected of participating in the rebellion were beheaded by the militia. &quot;Their severed heads were mounted on poles at crossroads as a grisly form of intimidation.&quot; Across the South, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people,[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_slave_rebellion#cite_note-3">3]</a> restricting rights of assembly and other civil rights for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_slave_rebellion#Retaliation">1</a></li>
<li>In 1822, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_Vesey">Denmark Vesey</a> a former slave who had purchased his freedom, began organizing his parish for a slave rebellion in Charleston, South Carolina. Vesey and his followers were said to be planning to kill slaveholders in Charleston, liberate the slaves, and sail to the black republic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti">Haiti</a> for refuge, but were arrested beforehand. Vesey and five slaves were among the first group of men rapidly judged guilty by the secret proceedings of a city-appointed Court and condemned to death; they were executed by hanging on July 2, 1822. In later proceedings, some 30 additional followers were executed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_Vesey#Conspiracy">1</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1811_German_Coast_Uprising">1811 German Coast Uprising</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_rebellion">revolt</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States">black slaves</a> in parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Orleans">Territory of Orleans</a>. Between 64 and 125 enslaved men marched from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_cane">sugar</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantations_in_the_American_South">plantations</a> near present-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaPlace,_Louisiana">LaPlace</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Coast">German Coast</a> toward the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans">New Orleans</a>. During their two-day, twenty-mile march, the men burned five plantation houses (three completely), several sugarhouses, and crops. White men led by officials of the territory formed militia companies to hunt down and kill the insurgents. Over the next two weeks, white planters and officials interrogated, tried and executed an additional 44 insurgents who had been captured. Executions were by hanging or decapitation. Whites displayed the bodies as a warning to intimidate slaves. The heads of some were put on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_%28weapon%29">pikes</a> and displayed at plantations. The alleged leader, Charles Deslondes, had his hands chopped off, was then shot in one thigh &amp; then the other, until they were both broken – then shot in the Body and before he had expired was put into a bundle of straw and roasted. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1811_German_Coast_Uprising">1</a></li>
<li>In the summer of 1800, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Prosser">Gabriel Prosser</a> planned a large slave rebellion in Richmond, Virginia. Information regarding the revolt was leaked prior to its execution, and he and twenty-five followers were taken captive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging">hanged</a> in punishment. In reaction, Virginia and other state legislatures passed restrictions on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_people_of_color">free blacks</a>, as well as prohibiting the education, assembly, and hiring out of slaves, to restrict their chances to learn and to plan similar rebellions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Prosser">1</a></li>
<li>In 1787, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise">Three-Fifths Compromise</a>, was a compromise between southern and northern states for how slaves should be counted for representation and taxation purposes, and determining how many seats a state would have in the house of representatives. Black slaves were counted as 3/5ths of a white person. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise">1</a></li>
<li>In the 18th and 19th centuries, US plantation owners benefitted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States">African Slavery</a>, which eventually became the dominant mode of production in the south. Words cannot do justice to the inhumanity of slavery as practiced by the US, but specific examples above will attempt to highlight its brutality. The total slave population in the South eventually reached 4 million before liberation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States">1</a></li>

<li>On June 14th, 2019, an off-duty cop, Salvador Sanchez, in Corona, CA, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/mother-pleaded-dont-shoot-off-duty-lapd-officer/story?id=65194501">shot and killed a mentally ill man, Kenneth French,</a>, as well as shooting his family 8 times, while his family was with shopping for fathers day at a Costco. &quot;I begged and told him not to shoot,&quot; his father Russell French said. &quot;I said we have no guns and my son is sick. He still shot.&quot; Sanchez then fired at least eight rounds, striking all three family members. A man inside Costco stood and prayed over Russell French as he lied on the ground bleeding, he said. Kenneth French was shot twice in his back, Galipo said. There were also two gunshot wounds in his armpit and shoulder area. After the shooting, Corona Police said Sanchez was assaulted &quot;without provocation&quot; before Sanchez opened fire. He was placed on administrative leave days after the shooting, into which the LAPD is conducting an internal investigation.</li>

One such facility, named <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/border-patrol-outdoor-detention-migrants-el-paso/">&quot;The Dog Pound&quot;</a>, by border patrol agents, had no running water, no tarp or safety from the elements. A group of prisoners were held in a single cell for 30 days without shower or clothes changes, in 100 degree temperatures. There is severe overcrowding in the El Paso camp, with as many as 76 migrants packed into a tiny cell designed for a maximum of 12 people. A number of children have died while being held, including <a href="https://ktla.com/2019/06/13/premature-baby-found-in-overcrowded-border-patrol-facility-in-texas/">one baby born in an overcrowded cell. The mother was never taken to a hospital</a>. <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/four-severely-ill-migrant-babies-hospitalized-after-lawyers-visited-border-patrol-facility_n_5d0d3bbce4b07ae90d9cfe4f?guccounter=1">4 toddlers in a Texas facility were so ill and neglected, that a lawyer intervened to force the government to hospitalize them.</a> Children are often <a href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/-it-s-inhumane-what-they-re-doing-says-mother-separated-from-daughter-at-the-border">taken from mothers</a>, due to the horrible conditions in the camps.

<li>On January 29th, 2019, Tempe Arizona police <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2019/01/30/family-tempe-teen-antonio-arce-killed-police-speaks/2702186002/">shot and killed a 14 year old, Antonio Arce.</a> He was shot in the back between his shoulder blades while running away. Police at first delayed, then released a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tempe-police-shooting-antonio-arce-bodycam-footage-in-fatal-shooting-of-boy-with-airsoft-gun/">small section of the bodycam footage, intentionally cut right before seeing the body, 3 days after the shooting.</a> After backlash over the shortened video, they held a <em>private showing</em> to select reporters, barring any cameras or recording devices, seemingly showing Arce with the orange-tipped airsoft gun found near his body. They've refused to release that video to the public, leading many to believe it to be doctored, with police planting an airsoft gun on him after the killing as a justification. The original video has no such airsoft gun. The officer who murdered him is currently on administrative leave.</li>
<li>On Nov 25, 2018, US customs and border agents <a href="https://www.apnews.com/72efa4f1822241c2817a2fb6aa191fb4">fired tear gas at hundreds of Central American migrants on the US border</a>. “We ran, but when you run, the gas asphyxiates you more,” Honduran migrant Ana Zuniga, 23, told the Associated Press while cradling daughter Valery, 3, in her arms. The use of tear gas <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2018/05/tear-gas-protests-riot-control-police">is banned in warfare</a>, while its use for riot control is internationally accepted. Protesters and amnesty seekers would have <em>more</em> rights and protections if they simply declared war on the US government.</li>
<li>In May 2018, at a California press conference regarding Sanctuary cities, Trump, referring to Mexican immigrants stated: &quot;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/16/trump-immigrants-animals-mexico-democrats-sanctuary-cities/617252002/">These aren't people. These are animals</a>&quot;.</li>
<li>Starting in April 2018, the Trump administration began a policy of separating families who attempt to cross the border. Separated children have been housed in a number of newly constructed tent facilities, such as <a href="https://bsnorrell.blogspot.com/2018/06/trumps-holocaust-us-child-concentration.html">one in Tornillo, TX</a>. Another facility in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/06/12/geronimo-japanese-were-imprisoned-there-now-fort-sill-will-hold-migrant-children-again/?utm_term=.131ebf2c94d8">Fort Sill, Oklahoma</a>, the same military prison that held Japanese and Apache civilians, will hold south american migrants. Andrea Pitzer, the author of “One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps&quot; writes, “While writing a book on camp history, I defined concentration camps as the mass detention of civilians without trial, usually on the basis of race, religion, national origin, citizenship, or political party, rather than anything a given individual has done. By this definition, the new child camp established in Tornillo, Texas, is a concentration camp.” Recently it has been found that the Trump administration has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/07/31/trump-administration-must-seek-consent-before-giving-drugs-to-migrant-children-judge-rules/?utm_term=.707cbb1c25f8">drugging children without consent</a>.

<li>Throughout 2018, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement">I.C.E.</a> started another wave of deportations, breaking up hundreds of families, and mandated the legal separation incoming parents from their children (presumably to deter future asylum-seekers). ICE arrested <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/06/11/angry-that-ice-is-ripping-families-apart-dont-just-blame-trump-blame-clinton-bush-and-obama-too/">114 people in Sandusky OH</a>. <a href="http://time.com/longform/donald-trump-immigration-policy-splitting-families/">Trump and Jeff Sessions have ramped up a trend of forcible deportations</a> started by Clinton and Obama.

In 2017, President Trump deported more than double the number of noncriminals than Obama had the previous year. Those deported include a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy in San Antonio; a grandmother described as the “backbone” of a Navy veteran’s family; a father of two in Detroit who had lived in the U.S. since he was 10 years old. A major consequence of this new policy has been an explosion of fear among immigrant communities “When everyone’s a target, no one is safe,” says Luis Zayas, dean of the Steve Hicks School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Austin. He cites instances of ICE agents arresting people who had just filed paperwork for a green card, left church or dropped off their kids at school. “The arrests feel arbitrary, and that’s different,” he says. “The fear is worse now than I’ve ever seen it.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/06/11/angry-that-ice-is-ripping-families-apart-dont-just-blame-trump-blame-clinton-bush-and-obama-too/">1</a>, <a href="http://time.com/longform/donald-trump-immigration-policy-splitting-families/">2</a>,<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/04/ice-agents-feel-more-empowered-than-ever-to-arrest-and-deport-even-the-lowest-priority-immigrants/">3</a></li>

The DACA policy was rescinded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration">Trump administration</a> on September 5, 2017, but full implementation of the rescission was delayed six months to give Congress time to decide how to deal with the population that was previously eligible under the policy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals">1</a></li>
<li>Beginning in May 2017, ICE began another wave of deportation targeting Mexicans. Hugo Mejia and a coworker, Rodrigo Nuñez, were imprisoned by ICE officials, despite living in the US for 17 years, and having clean records.<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/05/12/workers-detained-by-ice-while-doing-construction-job-on-military-base/">1</a></li>
<li>Beginning in 1994, sheriff <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Arpaio">Joe Arpaio</a> opened up a &quot;tent city&quot;, outside of phoenix, a facility which he called, his own &quot;personal concentration camp&quot;, used to house prisoners, in terrible conditions. In 2011, inmates complained that fans near their beds were not working, and that their shoes were melting from the heat.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Arpaio#cite_note-45">45]</a> During the summer of 2003, when outside temperatures exceeded 110 °F (43 °C), Arpaio said to complaining inmates, &quot;It's 120 degrees in Iraq and the soldiers are living in tents and they didn't commit any crimes, so shut your mouths!&quot;. Arpaio reinstuted chain gangs (for female prisoners as well), forcing people to work 7 hours a day, 7 days a week. Arpaio also entrapped 18-year-old James Saville into an assassination attempt against himself. Saville's attorneys eventually discovered that MCSO detectives had bought the bomb parts themselves, then convinced Saville to build it even though he was not predisposed to commit such a crime. On July 9, 2003, a Maricopa County Superior Court jury acquitted Saville, finding that the bomb plot was an elaborate publicity stunt to boost Arpaio's reelection bid. On April 4th, 2017, newly elected Phoenix sheriff Paul Penzone finally closed it down due to public pressure, after 23 years of operation. Trump pardoned sherriff Arpaio in August 2017, after holding a rally in Phoenix AZ in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8aKkaF93as">police tear-gassed protesters.</a> <a href="http://www.abc15.com/news/state/paul-penzone-to-shut-down-tent-city-after-decades-of-operation">1</a></li>

<li>In early 2017, ICE began a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/02/14/ice-arrested-nearly-700-people-last-week-advocates-are-bracing-for-more-to-come/">campaign of arrests and deportation</a> of undocumented immigrants. 700 People have been arrested so far. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/02/14/ice-arrested-nearly-700-people-last-week-advocates-are-bracing-for-more-to-come/">1</a></li>
<li>In the present day, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement#Case_samples">ICE (U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement)</a>, the police tasked with immigration enforcement, operates over 500 prison camps, holding over 34,000 undocumented people deemed &quot;aliens&quot;, 20,000 of which have no criminal convictions, in the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States#Criticisms">system of immigration detention</a>. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/opinions/reyes-immigration-detention/">The camps</a> include forced labor (often with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement#Corporate_contracts">contracts from private companies</a>), poor conditions, lack of rights (since the undocumented aren't considered citizens), and forced deportations, often splitting up families. Detainees are often held for a year without trial, with antiquated court procedures pushing back court dates for months, encouraging many to accept immediate deportation in the hopes of being able to return faster than the court can reach a decision, but forfeiting legal status, in a cruel system of coercion. After the creation of DHS and ICE, the budget for immigration enforcement doubled from <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-enforcement-united-states-rise-formidable-machinery">$6.2 billion in 2002 to $12.5 billion in 2006 under Obama.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States#Criticisms">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/opinions/reyes-immigration-detention/">2</a>,<a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-enforcement-united-states-rise-formidable-machinery">3</a></li>
<li>In 1996, in response to increased immigration from countries such as El Salvador and Guatemala ravaged by US imperialism and authoritarian dictatorships, the US passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996">Anti-Terrorism and effective Death Penalty Act</a>, allowing deportation of any immigrant ever convicted of a crime, no matter how long ago or how serious. Lawful permanent residents who had married Americans and now had children were not exempt. The <em>New York Times</em> reported in July that &quot;hundreds of long-term legal residents have been arrested since the law passed.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996">1</a></li>
<li>By 1984, during the Reagan-era of social services and welfare cutbacks, 42% of all Latino children and one-fourth of the families lived below the poverty line.</li>

Miners were subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance">undercover surveillance</a> by the Arizona Criminal Intelligence Systems Agency, to identify strikers engaged in violence, with the governor sending 325 National Guard soldiers to Morenci, and increasing the number of state policemen there to 425. Meanwhile, the local government passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction">injunctions</a> limiting both picketing and demonstrations at the mine.

<li>From 1929 - 1954, the US implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation">Mexican Repatriation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback">Operation Wetback</a>, a US law enforcement initiative under Eisenhower to curb Mexican immigration, in which over 1 Million Mexicans were arrested. After implementation, Operation Wetback gave rise to arrests and deportations by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Border_Patrol">U.S. Border Patrol</a> that were civil rights violations, which resulted in several hundred United States citizens being illegally deported without being given a chance to prove their citizenship. From 1929 - 1939, ~400k-2 Million people were deported, 40-60% of them lawful citizens, and many of them children. About 1.1 Million people were deported in 1954 alone. A total of 750 immigration and border patrol officers and investigators; 300 jeeps, cars and buses; and seven airplanes were allocated for the operation.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback#cite_note-28">28]</a> Teams were focused on quick processing, as planes were able to coordinate with ground efforts and quickly deport people into Mexico.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback#cite_note-ngai156-29">29]</a> While the operation included the cities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a>, its main targets were border areas in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback#cite_note-ngai156-29">29]</a> Overall, there were 1,078,168 apprehensions made in the first year of Operation Wetback, with 170,000 being rounded up from May to July 1954.

<li>Between 1956-65, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Confession_Program">Chinese Confession Program</a> sought confessions of illegal entry from US citizens and residents of Chinese origin, with the (misleading) offer of legalization of status in exchange.

<li>In the period following WWII, the US capitalist-controlled media, advertising, and consumer products industries propagandized and glorified the ideal of the housewife-consumer, in order to sell products, make labor space for returning soldiers, take advantage of women's unpaid labor in the home, and to help build a new workforce and potential army to combat the soviet union. This sparked an era of regression with respect to the feminist victories of the previous 50 years, and caused psychological damage and demoralization to an uncountable number of women. Women who remained in the labor force were primarily only allowed in subordinate positions such as secretaries, cleaning women, elementary school teachers, saleswomen, waitresses, and nurses.

The principle targets were the mentally ill, Native Americans, and blacks. For example, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_County,_Mississippi">Sunflower County Mississippi</a>, 60% of black women living there were sterilized without their permission.

<li>US elites in the 18th and 19th centuries pushed a narrative of <em>domestic purity</em>, or the <em>cult of true womanhood</em>, for women as a way of pacifying her with a doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot;-giving her work equally as important as the man's, but separate and different. Inside that &quot;equality&quot; there was the fact that the woman did not choose her mate, and once her marriage took place, her life was determined. One girl wrote in 1791: &quot;The die is about to be cast which will probably determine the future happiness or misery of my life.... I have always anticipated the event with a degree of solemnity almost equal to that which will terminate my present existence.&quot; Marriage enchained, and children doubled the chains.

<li>On December 5th, 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Miramar_shootout">police opened fire on a busy highway</a> in Miramar Florida, while in pursuit of 2 jewel thieves who stole $3k of jewelry, killing the kidnapped UPS driver, the two thieves, and an innocent 70-year-old bystander in traffic. <a href="https://twitter.com/rklueber28/status/1202722185690914817">The graphic video</a> shows complete negligence for the hostage, and surrounding drivers, all to recover some stolen jewelry. On a GoFundMe page that had raised more than $100,000 by Friday evening, Roy Ordonez wrote that his brother, the UPS driver, had been gunned “down like a criminal by the Florida police.” He asked people to share the fundraising page to “make people aware of trigger-happy police officers.” “They could have killed many more people, could have been one of your loved ones,” Roy Ordonez wrote. “Please don’t let my brother’s death be for nothing. Police need to be held accountable.”</li>
<li>In February 2019, an <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/florida-student-arrested-pledge-of-allegiance.amp">11 year old was arrested by police after refusing to say the pledge of allegiance.</a> The teacher then asked “Why if it was so bad here he did not go to another place to live,” “They brought me here,” the boy replied. Polk County Public Schools spokesman Kyle Kennedy insisted the 11-year-old “was arrested after becoming disruptive and refusing to follow repeated instructions by school staff and law enforcement.” The sixth grader was then taken to a juvenile detention center, charged with disrupting a school function and resisting arrest without violence.</li>
<li>In 2020, the state of Michigan implemented a policy of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/judges-are-locking-up-children-for-noncriminal-offenses-like-repeatedly-disobeying-their-parents-and-skipping-school#1019503">locking up children for non-criminal offenses.</a> This follows the trend of increasing police-presence within US schools, which have massively increased the number of students arrested for non-violent offenses.</li>
<li>In 2019, a Phoenix Arizona resident, Jim Stauffer, learned that the body of his deceased mother, Doris, who died in 2014, was one of <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/valley-man-learns-moms-body-was-sold-for-blast-testing">many bodies sold to the US army used for &quot;blast testing&quot;.</a> He had checked &quot;no&quot; on the paperwork for medical tests involving explosions. “She was then supposedly strapped in a chair on some sort of apparatus, and a detonation took place underneath her to basically kind of get an idea of what the human body goes through when a vehicle is hit by an IED.” Stauffer is one of many plaintiffs named in the suit against <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/crime/fbi-shines-light-on-now-shut-down-human-chop-shop-in-phoenix">Biologic Resource Center and its owner Stephen Gore.</a> Gore pleaded guilty to running an illegal enterprise in 2015, but was sentenced to serve probation.</li>

<li>Since January, 2013, over 21 US cities have enacted legislation to restrict giving food to the homeless, such as requiring expensive permits to discourage food donations in public spaces, or direct police intervention. In Tampa FL, on January 9th, 2017, police arrested 7 volunteers of Food Not Bombs and 1 homeless person to prevent them from distributing food. <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/In-Tampa-If-You-Share-Food-with-Homeless-Cops-Will-Raid-You-20170110-0003.html">1</a></li>
<li>From 1980s to the present day, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_for_Janitors">Justice for Janitors Campaigns</a> (a group fighting against the low wages and minimal health-care coverage given to janitors worldwide) in the US have been the target of police arrests and crackdowns.

<li>In 1996, Congress signed into law the deceptively titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act">Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act</a>, which capitalized on a demonization of the poor as being lazy (in reality there was a lack of jobs, and low-wage work proved unable to sustain most families), in order to dismantle welfare benefits. Its aim was to force poor families receiving federal cash benefits (many of them single mothers with children) to go to work, by cutting off their benefits after two years, limiting lifetime benefits to five years, and allowing people without children to get food stamps for only three months in any three-year period. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act">1</a></li>
<li>In 1988, Police charged a tent city/homeless center in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompkins_Square_Park_riot_(1988)">Tompkins square</a>, arresting and clubbing protesters, injuring 35 people and arresting 9 more. &quot;It's time to bring a little law and order back to the park and restore it to the legitimate members of the community,&quot; said Captain McNamara. &quot;We don't want to get into a situation where we under-police something like this and it turns into a fiasco.&quot; Protesters held up signs saying &quot;Gentrification is Class War&quot;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompkins_Square_Park_riot_(1988)">1</a></li>

<li>In 1985-86, Hormel workers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormel#1985_strike">went on strike</a> in Austin Minnesota, due to a cutwage from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduced benefits. After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota">Governor of Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Perpich">Rudy Perpich</a>, called in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard">National Guard</a> to protect the strikebreakers. The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormel#1985_strike">1</a></li>
<li>In 1983, a mostly latino workforce lead the 3-year long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_copper_mine_strike_of_1983">Arizona Copper Mine Strike of 1983</a>, in which the police, national guard, and Arizona governor assisted in one of the largest strikebreaking incidents of the 1980s, ending with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phelps_Dodge_Corporation">Phelps Dodge Corporation</a> replacing most of the workers and decertifying the unions. Miners were subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance">undercover surveillance</a> by the Arizona Criminal Intelligence Systems Agency, to identify strikers engaged in violence, with the governor sending 325 National Guard soldiers to Morenci, and increasing the number of state policemen there to 425. Meanwhile, the local government passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction">injunctions</a> limiting both picketing and demonstrations at the mine. The Arizona copper mine strike would later become a symbol of defeat for American unions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_copper_mine_strike_of_1983">1</a></li>
<li>In 1981, the union <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Air_Traffic_Controllers_Organization_(1968)">PATCO (Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization)</a>, went on strike for better working conditions, pay, and a shorter work week. The union was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decertification">decertified</a>, declared illegal, and the strike broken by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan">Reagan Administration</a>. It is considered one of the last death throes of the US labor movement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Air_Traffic_Controllers_Organization_(1968)">1</a></li>
<li>In May, 1970, the Ohio national guard shot and killed 4 college students, and wounded 9 others in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings">Kent State Shootings</a>. Some of the students who were shot had been protesting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Campaign">Cambodian Bombing Campaign</a>, which President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> announced during a television address on April 30. Other students who were shot had been walking nearby or observing the protest from a distance. There was a significant national response to the shootings: hundreds of universities, colleges, and high schools closed throughout the US due to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_strike_of_1970">student strike of 4 million students</a>, and the event further affected public opinion, at an already socially contentious time, over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_the_United_States_in_the_Vietnam_War">role of the United States in the Vietnam War</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings">1</a></li>
<li>In 1969, after Berkeley student's reclaimed people's park, in order to clean it up, then Governor Ronald Reagan sent in police, and the national guard, calling the students, &quot;communist sympathizers&quot;, and a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/chronicle_vault/article/People-s-Park-Bloody-Thursday-50-years-later-13845759.php#photo-17361860">bloody conflict ensued</a>.

<li>From 1947-56, beginning with a 1947 Truman Executive order that required all federal civil services employees to be screen for &quot;loyalty&quot;, a second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare">Red Scare</a> took place with senator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> at its head, accusing large numbers of people of being communist infiltrators and homosexuals, resulting in hundreds of imprisonments and some 10,000-12,000 people accused losing their jobs. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union">union</a> activists, who McCarthy publicly targeted through the anti-communist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee">House of Un-American Activies Committee (HUAC)</a> hearings or public statements. The number imprisoned is in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism#cite_note-54">54]</a> In many cases simply being subpoenaed by HUAC or one of the other committees was sufficient cause to be fired.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism#cite_note-55">55]</a> In the context of the Cold War, McCarthy framed homosexuality as a dangerous, contagious social disease that posed a potential threat to state security.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism#cite_note-Patrizia_Gentile_2010._pg_65-59">59]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism#Victims_of_McCarthy">1</a></li>
<li>In 1947, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Management_Relations_Act_of_1947">Taft-Hartley Act</a> remains an anti-worker law intended to dismantle and break up labor unions (around 1/4 workers were in unions at that time). It was passed by capitalists as a response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_wave_of_1945%E2%80%9346">the post-WW2 strike wave of 1945-46</a>, as more than 5 million workers went on strike during the labor upsurge of returning soldiers. The Taft–Hartley Act prohibited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdictional_strike">jurisdictional strikes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_strike_action">wildcat strikes</a>, solidarity or political strikes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_action">secondary boycotts</a>, secondary and mass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing_%28protest%29">picketing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_shop">closed shops</a>, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns. It also required union officers to sign non-communist affidavits with the government. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_shop">Union shops</a> were heavily restricted, and states were allowed to pass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-work_law">right-to-work laws</a> that ban agency fees. Furthermore, the executive branch of the federal government could obtain legal strikebreaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction">injunctions</a> if an impending or current strike imperiled the national health or safety. The amendments required unions and employers to give 80 days' notice to each other and to certain state and federal mediation bodies before they may undertake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action">strikes</a> or other forms of economic action in pursuit of a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining_agreement">collective bargaining agreement</a>. Anyone opposed to the act was labeled a communist, in the rising red scare initiated by McCarthy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Management_Relations_Act_of_1947">1</a></li>
<li>In 1934, in the midst of the worsening conditions of the great depression, 400,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile">textile</a> workers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Southern_states">U.S. Southern states</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_workers_strike_(1934)#The_authorities_respond">went on strike</a> for 22 days. Deputies and armed strikebreakers in South Carolina fired on pickets, killing seven, wounding twenty others. State authorities aided by the national guard suppressed the strikes, killing and arresting dozens of picketers and strikers across the nation. Governor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibra_Charles_Blackwood">Blackwood</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina">South Carolina</a> called out the National Guard with orders to shoot to kill any picketers who tried to enter the mills. Other governors soon followed suit. Nate Shaw, a black alabama sharecropper on strike, was shot and arrested in late 1932, and served twelve years in an Alabama prison.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_workers_strike_(1934)#The_authorities_respond">1</a></li>
<li>In 1934, sailors in San Francisco began a general strike known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1934_West_Coast_waterfront_strike">1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike</a>. Police attempted to break up the strike by shooting tear gas into the crowd, and charging the protesters on horseback. Police then fired shotguns and revolvers into the crowd, killing 6 workers, in an event known as &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;. A state of emergency was declared, and the governor sent in the california national guard and federal army soldiers with machine gun mounted trucks to assist vigilante strike-breakers. Over 150 workers were arrested. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1934_West_Coast_waterfront_strike">1</a></li>
<li>In 1932, A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army">Bonus Army</a> consisting of 43,000 poor WWI veterans and their supporters gathered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in to demand cash-payment redemption of their service certificates. Four troops of cavalry, four companies of infantry, a machine gun squadron, and six tanks assembled near the White House. General Douglas MacArthur was in charge of the operation, Major Dwight Eisenhower his aide. George S. Patton was one of the officers. MacArthur led his troops down Pennsylvania Avenue, used tear gas to clear veterans out of the old buildings, and set the buildings on fire. Then the army moved across the bridge to Anacostia. Thousands of veterans,wives, children, began to run as the tear gas spread. The soldiers set fire to some of the huts, and soon the whole encampment was ablaze. When it was all over, two veterans had been shot to death,an eleven-week-old baby had died, an eight-year-old boy was partially blinded by gas, two police had fractured skulls, and a thousand veterans were injured by gas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army#Police_shooting">1</a></li>
<li>In the 1930s, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County_War">Harlan County War</a>, was a series of coal mining-related skirmishes, executions, bombings, and strikes that took place in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County,_Kentucky">Harlan County, Kentucky</a>. The incidents involved coal miners and union organizers on one side, organizing their workplaces and fighting for better wages and working conditions, and coal firms and law enforcement officials on the other. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County_War">1</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>, caused by a capitalist speculative bubble throughout 1920s, hit working families the hardest, and along with the Dust Bowl, resulted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">Great Depression</a>, which had devastating social and economic effects on working people everywhere. Unemployment skyrocketed to 25%, poverty and hunger increased, and many families were displaced and forced to leave their homes in search of work elsewhere. The worsening material conditions gave rise to a large movement of industrial unionism (mainly the AFL-CIO), and many large strikes in which workers fought to regain their livelihood. This growing revolutionary movement scared American capitalists into making concessions, and was only pacified by the promises of FDR's social-democratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal">New Deal</a>, which had the effect of preserving American Capitalism, and dismantling the growing labor movement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929">1</a></li>
<li>In the late 1920s, during prohibition, the <a href="http://www.slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/jeff-merkley-child-detention-video-democratic-messaging-that-works.html">US treasury department, under orders from Calvin Coolidge's government, intentionally poisoned alcohol supplies</a> leading to the deaths of at least 700 people, with thousands more suffering from alcohol poisoning from methyl alcohol. Public health officials responded with shock. &quot;The government knows it is not stopping drinking by putting poison in alcohol,&quot; said New York City medical examiner Charles Norris, &quot;[Y]et it continues its poisoning processes, heedless of the fact that people determined to drink are daily absorbing that poison. Knowing this to be true, the United States government must be charged with the moral responsibility for the deaths that poisoned liquor causes, although it cannot be held legally responsible.&quot; Most of those sickened and dying were those &quot;who cannot afford expensive protection and deal in low grade stuff.&quot; The program was finally ended in 1933. <a href="http://www.slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/jeff-merkley-child-detention-video-democratic-messaging-that-works.html">1</a></li>
<li>In 1922, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1922">Great Railroad Strike of 1922</a> was a 400,000 person-strong nationwide strike of railroad workers, with police and armed company guards killing 10 workers or their family members. Troops bolstered armed company guards in their work protecting railroad property and aiding in the defense and transportation of strikebreakers, thereby working to undermine the strike effort.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1922#cite_note-Power89-12">12]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1922#Conflict_and_violence">1</a></li>

Shooting of undetermined origins resulted in the deaths of two coal miners, seven agents, and the mayor, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Hatfield">Sheriff Sid Hatfield siding with the miners to defend them</a>. Afterward, when the charges against Hatfield and 22 others for the murder of Albert Felts were dismissed, Baldwin-Felts detectives assassinated Hatfield and his deputy Ed Chambers on August 1, 1921, on the steps of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDowell_County_Courthouse_%28West_Virginia%29">McDowell County courthouse</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch,_West_Virginia">Welch</a>, West Virginia.

<li>In 1919, An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_General_Strike">IWW general strike took place in Seattle, Washington</a>, in which dissatisfied workers in several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union">unions</a> began a strike to gain higher wages after two years of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">World War I</a> wage controls. The strike was put down by the City's mayor, who called in federal troops and nearby police. 39 labor leaders labeled as 'Bolsheviki' were arrested, with Seattle's mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Hanson">Ole Hanson</a> taking credit for ending the strike. He resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of &quot;domestic bolshevism&quot;, earning $38,000 in seven months, five times his annual salary as mayor. After WWI, the IWW was largely dismantled. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_General_Strike">1</a></li>
<li>In 1919, A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia_massacre_(Washington)">massacre in Centralia Washington</a> occurred when the city-supported American legion attacked IWW labor organizers, killing 6 people. Frank Everett, one of the wobbly organizers, escaped, was dragged back to town behind an automobile, suspended him from a telegraph pole, then locked him in jail. That night, his jailhouse door was broken down, he was dragged out,put on the floor of a car, his genitals were cut off, and then he was taken to a bridge, lynched, and his body riddled with bullets. Seven wobblies were imprisoned and sentenced to 25-40 years by city officials. The primary reason for this was that the growing anti-war labor movement was seen as a threat to capitalists in Centralia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia_massacre_(Washington)">1</a></li>
<li>In 1914, Woodrow Wilson instituted the first modern draft (fighting without pay), since only 73,000 people volunteered (indicating low support for the war), and plunged American workers into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">WWI</a>, widely regarded as an <a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnwarhea14.html">imperialist war</a> between European capitalist powers over boundaries, colonies, and spheres of influence in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, in which millions were killed and wounded.

The national and camp guards killed 19-26 people, including two women and eleven children. To finish clearing out the camp, the Guard moved down from the hills with torches, set fire to the tents, and the families fled into the hills. In retaliation for Ludlow, the miners armed themselves and attacked dozens of mines over the next ten days, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 40-mile front from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad,_Colorado">Trinidad</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsenburg,_Colorado">Walsenburg</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-2">2]</a> The entire strike would cost between 69 and 199 lives.

Lawrence police killed 2 people, beat a pregnant woman to miscarriage, and arrested &gt;250. Congressional hearings followed, resulting in exposure of shocking conditions in the Lawrence mills and calls for investigation of the &quot;wool trust.&quot; Mill owners soon decided to settle the strike, giving workers in Lawrence and throughout New England raises of up to 20 percent.

<li>In 1892, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Strike">Homestead Strike</a> was an industrial lockout and strike between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania steel workers, and the Carnegie steel company, who hired armed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkerton_National_Detective_Agency">Pinkertons</a> to act as strike-breakers. It culminated in a battle between strikers and private security agents on July 6, 1892.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Strike#cite_note-3">3]</a> The battle was one of the most serious disputes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_history_of_the_United_States">U.S. labor history</a>, third behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre">Ludlow Massacre</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain">Battle of Blair Mountain</a>.

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_Wars">Coal Wars</a> were a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_conflict">armed</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_dispute">labor conflicts</a> in the US between striking workers, and the police and paid private security firms, between 1890 and 1930. Although they occurred mainly in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_United_States">East</a>, particularly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia">Appalachia</a>, there was a significant amount of violence in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado">Colorado</a> after the turn of the century. Coal capitalists paid private detectives as well as public law enforcement agents to ensure that union organizers were kept out of the region, using intimidation, harassment, espionage, and murder. Mining families lived under the terror of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin-Felts_Detective_Agency">Baldwin-Felts</a> detective agents who were professional strikebreakers under the hire of coal operators.

<li>In 1886, Chicago police killed several workers, and arrested many more striking in support of an 8-hour work day. The next day, they then attempted to break up the strike, upon which an unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at police, killing several, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair">Haymarket Affair</a>.

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1877#Reading">Great Railroad strike of 1877</a> was a nationwide strike in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Illinois, and Missouri, after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_%26_Ohio_Railroad">Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad</a> (B&amp;O) cut wages for the third time in a year. The strike finally ended some 45 days later after it was put down by local and state militias, and federal troops, who murdered around ~100 workers or family members, and arrested ~1000 people. A newspaper recounting the situation in Chicago reports: &quot;The sound of clubs falling on skulls was sickening for the first minute, until one grew accustomed to it. A rioter dropped at every whack, it seemed, for the ground was covered with them.&quot; The railroads made some concessions, withdrew some wage cuts, but also strengthened their &quot;Coal and Iron Police.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1877#Reading">1</a></li>
<li>In 1874, Police charged and broke up a labor demonstration of unemployed workers in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompkins_Square_riot_(1874)">Tompkins Square</a>, New York.

<li>In 1841, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorr_Rebellion">Dorrs's Rebellion</a> was an armed insurrection against Rhode Island elites in order to give universal suffrage to factory workers and immigrants, previously only granted to those who owned land and had at least $134. Dorr had originally supported granting voting rights to blacks, but he changed his position in 1840 because of pressure from white immigrants, who wanted to gain the vote first. The &quot;Dorrites&quot; led an unsuccessful attack against the arsenal in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a> on May 19, 1842. Dorr eventually disbanded his forces, realizing that he would be defeated in battle by the approaching militia, and fled the state.

<li>Throughout the late 1800s, robber barons and wealthy industrialists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan">J.P.

The wealthy capitalists pushed state and federal legislation to serve their interests, and succeeded in enlisting the police to serve their interests, including pushing farmers and Native Americans off their land. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George">Henry George</a> and others criticized the immense accumulation of property, pointing out that the lowest classes did not share in the gains of luxury and comfort.</li>
<li>In the 1830s, after the accumulation of farmland by a few wealthy families, thousands of farmers forced to rent their land formed Anti-Rent associations to prevent evictions, culminating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Rent_War">Anti-Rent War</a>, a guerilla war between bands of sheriffs and farmers. The wealthy used sheriffs and deputies to evict thousands of returning civil war veterans unable to pay rent. The farmers had fought, been crushed by the law, their struggle diverted into voting, and the system stabilized by enlarging the class of small landowners, leaving the basic structure of rich and poor
intact. It was a common sequence in American history.</li>
<li>From 1786-87, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion">Shays' Rebellion</a> was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_uprising">armed uprising</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> over dissatisfaction from returning veterans. The rural farming population was generally unable to meet the demands being made of them by merchants or the civil authorities, and individuals began to lose their land and other possessions when they were unable to fulfill their debt and tax obligations. This led to strong resentments against tax collectors and the courts, where creditors obtained and enforced judgments against debtors, and where tax collectors obtained judgments authorizing property seizures. It,and similar conflicts and unrest were pacified by the passing of the 1789 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights">Bill of Rights</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion">1</a></li>
<li>In 1787, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison">James Madison</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers">Federalist Paper</a> #10, outlined the primary role of the US constitution, arguing that representative government was needed to maintain peace in a society ridden by factional disputes. These disputes came from &quot;<strong>the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.</strong>&quot; The problem, he said, was how to control the factional struggles that came from inequalities in wealth. Minority factions could be controlled, he said, by the principle that decisions would be by vote of the majority. So the real problem, according to Madison, was a majority faction, and here the solution was offered by the Constitution, to have &quot;an extensive republic,&quot; that is, a large nation ranging over thirteen states, for then &quot;it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength,and to act in unison with each other.... The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.&quot; Madison's argument can be seen as a sensible argument for having a government which can maintain peace and avoid continuous disorder. But is it the aim of government simply to maintain order, as a referee, between two equally matched fighters? Or is it that government has some special interest in maintaining a certain kind of order, a certain distribution of power and wealth, a distribution in which government officials are not neutral referees but participants? In that case, the disorder they might worry about is the disorder of popular rebellion against those monopolizing the society's wealth. This interpretation makes sense when one looks at the economic interests, the social backgrounds, of the makers of the Constitution. Charles Beard warned us that <strong>governments-including the government of the United States-are not neutral, that they represent the dominant economic interests, and that their constitutions are intended to serve these interests.</strong></li>
<li>The 1787 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution">US Constitution</a> is falsely portrayed as a document representing an ideal of social and political equality, despite <strong>every framer being a rich white propertied man</strong>. Historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Beard">Charles Beard</a> found that a majority of the framers were lawyers by profession, that most of them were <strong>men of wealth, in land, slaves, manufacturing, or shipping</strong>, that half of them had money loaned out at interest, and that forty of the fifty-five held government bonds, according to the records of the Treasury Department. Thus, Beard found that most of the makers of the Constitution had some direct economic interest in establishing a strong federal government: the manufacturers needed protective tariffs; the money lenders wanted to stop the use of paper money to pay off debts; the land speculators wanted protection as they invaded Indian lands; slave-owners needed federal security against slave revolts and runaways; bondholders wanted a government able to raise money by nationwide taxation, to pay off those bonds. Four groups, Beard noted, were not represented in the Constitutional Convention: <strong>slaves, indentured servants, women, men without property</strong>. And so the Constitution did not reflect the interests of those groups. He later wrote: &quot;Inasmuch as the primary object of a government, beyond the mere repression of physical violence, is the making of the rules which <em>determine the property relations of members of society</em>, the dominant classes whose rights are thus to be determined must perforce obtain from the government such rules as are consonant with the larger interests necessary to the continuance of their economic processes, or they must themselves control the organs of government.&quot;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_revolution">American Revolution</a> is falsely portrayed as being a social revolution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Neumann_Degler">Carl Degler</a> says (<em>Out of Our Past</em>): &quot;<strong>No new social class came to power through the door of the American revolution.</strong> The men who engineered the revolt were largely members of the colonial ruling class.&quot; <strong>George Washington was the richest man in America</strong>. John Hancock was a prosperous Boston merchant. Benjamin Franklin was a wealthy printer. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Morgan_(historian)">Edmund Morgan</a> sums up the class nature of the Revolution this way: &quot;The fact that the lower ranks were involved in the contest should not obscure the fact that the contest itself was generally a struggle for office and power between members of an upper class: the new against the established.&quot; Looking at the situation after the Revolution, Richard Morris comments: &quot;Everywhere one finds inequality.&quot; He finds &quot;the people&quot; of &quot;We the people of the United States&quot; (a phrase coined by the very rich governor Morris) did not mean Indians or blacks or women or white servants. In fact, there were more indentured servants than ever, and the Revolution &quot;did nothing to end and little to ameliorate white bondage.&quot;</li>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs">War On Drugs</a>, a policy of arrest and imprisonment targeting minorities, first initiated by Nixon, has over the years created a monstrous system of mass incarceration, resulting in the imprisonment of 1.5 million people each year, with the US having the most prisoners per capita of any nation. One in five black Americans will spend time behind bars due to drug laws. The war has created a permanent underclass of impoverished people who have few educational or job opportunities as a result of being punished for drug offenses, in a vicious cycle of oppression. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs#cite_note-59">1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs">2</a></li>

Detainees are often held for a year without trial, with antiquated court procedures pushing back court dates for months, encouraging many to accept immediate deportation in the hopes of being able to return faster than the court can reach a decision, but forfeiting legal status, in a cruel system of coercion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States#Criticisms">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/opinions/reyes-immigration-detention/">2</a></li>
<li>Over 90% of criminal trials in the US are settled not by a judge or jury, but with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain">plea bargaining</a>, a system where the defendant agrees to plead guilty in return for a concession from the prosecutor. It has been statistically shown to benefit prosecutors, who &quot;throw the book&quot; at defendants by presenting a slew of charges, manipulating their fear, who in turn accept a lesser charge, regardless of their innocence, in order to avoid a worst outcome. The number of potentially innocent prisoners coerced into accepting a guilty plea is impossible to calculate. Plea bargaining can present a dilemma to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_attorney">defense attorneys</a>, in that they must choose between vigorously seeking a good deal for their present client, or maintaining a good relationship with the prosecutor for the sake of helping future clients. Plea bargaining is forbidden in most European countries. John Langbein has equated plea bargaining to medieval torture: &quot;There is, of course, a difference between having your limbs crushed if you refuse to confess, or suffering some extra years of imprisonment if you refuse to confess, but the difference is of degree, not kind. Plea bargaining, like torture, is coercive. Like the medieval Europeans, the Americans are now operating a procedural system that engages in condemnation without adjudication.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain#Controversy">1</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States#Criticism">grand jury</a> is a special legal proceeding in which a prosecutor may hold a trial before the real one, where ~20 jurors listen to evidence and decide whether criminal charges should be brought. Grand juries are rarely made up of a jury of the defendant's peers, and defendants do not have the right to an attorney, making them essentially show-trials for the prosecution, who often find ways of using grand jury testimony to intimidate the accused, such as leaking stories about grand jury testimony to the media to defame the accused. In the murders of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice, all of whom were unarmed and killed by police in 2014, grand juries decided in all 3 cases not to pursue criminal trials against the officers. The US and Liberia are the only countries where grand juries are still legal. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States#Criticism">1</a></li>

<li>Between 1850 and 2011, according to the World Resources Institute, the United States was the source of <a href="http://www.wri.org/blog/2014/11/6-graphs-explain-world%E2%80%99s-top-10-emitters">27 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions causing global warming</a>; the European Union, 25 percent; China, 11 percent; Russia, 8 percent; and Japan, 4 percent. These emissions have led to the emergence of large-scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming_on_humans">environmental hazards to human health</a>, such as extreme weather, ozone depletion, increased danger of wildland fires, loss of biodiversity, stresses to food-producing systems and the global spread of infectious diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 160,000 deaths, since 1950, are directly attributable to climate change. Many believe this to be a conservative estimate. To date, much less research has been conducted on the impacts of climate change on health, food supply, economic growth, migration, security, societal change, and public goods, such as drinking water, than on the geophysical changes related to global warming.<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/america-is-the-worst-polluter-in-the-history-of-the-world-we-should-let-climate-change-refugees-resettle-here/2015/06/25/28a55238-1a9c-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5_story.html">1</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming_on_humans">2</a></li>

<li>In 1987, FBI agent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ryan_(FBI_agent)">Jack Ryan</a> was arrested for refusing to investigate non-violent activists. He lost his job in September 1987 ten months short of retirement. He was thus ineligible for a full pension and had to live in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_shelter">homeless shelter</a>.

<li>In 1976, the US tested <a href="https://www.projectcensored.org/4-agent-white/">Agent White</a>, a powerful pesticide developed by Dow Chemical, in Cherokee county, North Carolina. Within 3 years, the rate of cancer deaths leapt to 60% above the national average.</li>
<li>In 1968, the US army tested VX gas, a nerve agent to be used in biological warfare, in the Skull valley Indian reservation in Utah. 27 miles away from the test, 6,000 sheep died, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident">Dugway sheep incident</a>. Since its founding in 1941, much of the activity at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_Proving_Ground" title="Dugway Proving Ground">Dugway Proving Ground</a> has been a closely guarded secret. Activities at Dugway included aerial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_agent" title="Nerve agent">nerve agent</a> testing.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident#cite_note-norrell-2">[2]</a> According to reports from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Scientist" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a></em>, Dugway was still producing small quantities of non-infectious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax" title="Anthrax">anthrax</a> of a type used in the making of vaccines as late as 1998, 30 years after the United States renounced biological weapons.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident#cite_note-hambling-3">[3]</a> There were at least 1,100 other chemical tests at Dugway during the time period of the Dugway sheep incident.

<li>In 1968, the CIA implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS">Operation CHAOS</a>, a spying program targeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society">Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party">Black Panthers</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Lords">Young Lords</a>, Women Strike for Peace, and Ramparts Magazine, in an effort to tie vietnam anti-war protests to foreign intervention. CIA agents went undercover as student radicals to spy on and disrupt campus organizations protesting the Vietnam War. In total, Operation CHAOS contained files on 7,200 Americans, and a computer index totaling 300,000 civilians and approximately 1,000 groups, with no foreign interventionism found. The operation was halted after the watergate break-in, and exposed a few years later. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS">1</a></li>
<li>In January 1961, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/12/us/north-carolina-nuclear-bomb-drop/index.html">US air force accidentally dropped two nuclear bombs on North Carolina, each of them 250x the strength of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima, and one of them came very close to detonating</a>. This was covered up for nearly 50 years. In 2013, the US finally <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/12/us/north-carolina-nuclear-bomb-drop/index.html">admitted the coverup and released the classified documents.</a> Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated: &quot;By the slightest margin of chance, literally the failure of two wires to cross, a nuclear explosion was averted.&quot; The estimated death tolls would have been 28,000 dead with 26,000 people injured.</li>
<li>In the 1960s, the CIA implemented an operation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_Kitty">Acoustic Kitty</a>, to spy on the soviet union. Veterinary surgeons implanted a microphone in cat's ear canals, a small radio transmitter at the base of its skull and a thin wire into its fur.</li>
<li>Beginning in August, 1956, <strong>COINTELPRO</strong> (a portmanteau derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence"><strong>CO</strong>unter <strong>INTEL</strong>ligence</a> <strong>PRO</strong>gram) was a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation">covert</a>, and often illegal, projects conducted by the United States <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting and disrupting domestic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_organizations">political organizations</a>. COINTELPRO resources targeted groups and individuals that the FBI deemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversive">subversive</a>, including anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a> organizers, activists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Power_movement">Black Power movement</a> (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party">Black Panther Party</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist">feminist</a> organizations, anti-colonial movements (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_independence">Puerto Rican independence</a> groups like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Lords">Young Lords</a>), and a variety of organizations that were part of the broader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left">New Left</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation">FBI Director</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a> ordered FBI agents to &quot;expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, neutralize or otherwise eliminate&quot; the activities of these movements and especially their leaders.</li>
<li>In 1953, the CIA begins <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">Project MKUltra</a>, a human testing program. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through mind control. MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture. The scope was broad, with research undertaken at 80 institutions, including 44 colleges and universities, as well as hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. Many subjects died under testing, or committed suicide. Others such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Olson">Frank Olson</a> were murdered for threatening to expose the program. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">1</a></li>
<li>In 1950, the US Navy secretly infected over 800,000 residents of the San Fransisco Bay Area with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serratia_marcescens">Serratia marcescens</a>, a human pathogen known to cause urinary and respiratory infections, during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray">Operation Sea-Spray</a>, in one of the largest human experiments in history. The residents of the area were not informed, making the event a serious violation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code">Nuremberg Code</a> on medical ethics. In the following month, 11 residents checked in at a local hospital with a rare urinary tract infection (one patient, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_J._Nevin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Edward J. Nevin</a> died as a result), and the area saw a spike in pneumonia cases. The military tested biological agents on US citizens in at least six other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray#Similar_tests">similar tests</a> causing a variety of symptoms such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/12/17/report-suggests-cia-involvement-in-fla-illnesses/5b10205e-170b-4e38-b64e-2e9bca8f50df/">whooping cough</a> throughout the 50s and 60s in Florida, the Midwest, New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray">1</a></li>
<li>From 1945-70s, Scientists working under the Manhattan Project and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission">US atomic energy commission</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plutonium_Files">injected hundreds of US citizens with plutonium</a>, including children and pregnant women. In Nashville, pregnant women were given radioactive mixtures. In Cincinnati, some 200 patients were irradiated over a period of 15 years. In Chicago, 102 people received injections of strontium and caesium solutions. In Massachusetts, 57 developmentally disabled children were fed oatmeal laced with radioactive tracers in an experiment sponsored by MIT and the Quaker Oats Company. In none of these cases were the subjects informed about the nature of the procedures, and thus could not have provided informed consent. During atomic testing, US soldiers and families who lived downwind from the blast were deliberately exposed to nuclear bomb blasts and radiation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plutonium_Files">1</a>&gt;</li>
<li>Prior to WWII, under the banner of &quot;Fitter Families for the future&quot;, many US states practiced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States">eugenics</a>, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization#United_States">forced sterilizations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia_in_the_United_States">euthanasia</a>, and better baby contests. After the eugenics movement was well established in the United States, it spread to Germany. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_California">California eugenicists</a> began producing literature promoting eugenics and sterilization and sending it overseas to German scientists and medical professionals. By 1933, California had subjected more people to forceful sterilization than all other U.S. states combined. The forced sterilization program engineered by the Nazis was partly inspired by California's. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a> helped develop and fund various German eugenics programs, including the one that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele">Josef Mengele</a> worked in before he went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States">1</a></li>

The law was primarily aimed at further restricting immigration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe">Southern Europeans</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe">Eastern Europeans</a>, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_people">Italians</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_European_Jews">Eastern European Jews</a>. In addition, it severely restricted the immigration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans">Africans</a> and outright banned the immigration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Americans">Arabs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans">Asians</a>. According to the U.S. Department of State <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Historian">Office of the Historian</a> the purpose of the act was &quot;to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity&quot;. The new quotas for immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe were so restrictive that in 1924 there were more Italians, Czechs, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Portuguese, Romanians, Spaniards, Jews, Chinese, and Japanese that left the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> than those who arrived as immigrants.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924">1</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>, signed into law in 1798, originally made it harder for an immigrant to become a citizen, but was later used during WWII by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt">President Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> to imprison <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people">Japanese</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_people">German</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_people">Italian</a> aliens during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>, with continued use after the war by Truman to imprison and deport people. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts">1</a></li>
