<p>Richard Thoman is the CEO of Xerox Corporation. When asked how would he intend to increase the value of the company?</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing sales</li>
<li>Creating new leading-edge product lines.</li>
<li>Creating Physical Assets to the company</li>
<li>Mergers and acquisitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>But Thoman wasn’t content with such conventional strategies. He believes one of the strategic keys to Xerox’s future is something so intangible, so invisible to traditional corporate practice.</p>
<p>He focused on Intellectual property and its management at Xerox. Companies that are good at managing IP will win. The ones that aren’t will lose.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-patent" tabindex="-1">What is a Patent? <a class="direct-link" href="#what-is-a-patent" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A patent is an exclusive right granted by the Government to the inventor to exclude others to use, make and sell an invention.</li>
<li>Right is given for a specific period of time, typically 20 years.</li>
<li>The main aim to enact a patent law is to encourage inventors to contribute more in their field by awarding them exclusive rights for their inventions.</li>
<li>In modern terms, the patent is usually referred to as the right granted to an inventor for his Invention of any new, useful, non-obvious process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three basic tests for any invention to be patentable:</p>
<ul>
<li>The invention must be <strong>NOVEL</strong>, must not be in existence.</li>
<li>The invention must be <strong>NON-OBVIOUS</strong>, i.e. a significant improvement to the previous one; mere change in technology will not give the right of the patent to the inventor.</li>
<li>The invention must be <strong>USEFUL</strong> in a bonafide manner, meaning thereby that the Invention must not be solely used in any illegal work and is useful to the world in a bonafide manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-intellectual-property-ip" tabindex="-1">What is Intellectual Property (IP)? <a class="direct-link" href="#what-is-intellectual-property-ip" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>IP may include original ideas; research results; critical business information</li>
<li>IP emanates from human creative labor</li>
<li>IP is different from <em>real property</em></li>
<li>Real property is tangible, has defined boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different kinds of IPR, for e.g., inventions are protected by patents. Literary works are protected by copyright. IP is different from IPR</p>
<h4 id="meaning-of-right-in-ipr" tabindex="-1">Meaning of ‘right’ in IPR <a class="direct-link" href="#meaning-of-right-in-ipr" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>What is a ‘right’:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A legal entitlement which is recognized and
can be protected and the violation of which
is deemed as ‘unlawful’ and leaves the right-
holder with a remedy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rights can be used in 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>as a liberty (gives the right-holder freedom to do certain acts)</li>
<li>as a licence (right to do something because someone has given you the consent)</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain rights manifest are inherent in a human
being (Eg: human rights, right to vote, right to
privacy), while certain rights manifest themselves
outside human beings (Eg: rights in property).</p>
<p>A right must be recognized by law. Rights can be general i.e. claimed by every citizen
(e.g. right to protection by the State) or exclusive
i.e. the right-holder can stop others from doing
certain acts without his consent (e.g. right to property)</p>
<p>IPR refers to rights which emanate from IP
which are capable of being protected (Eg:
copyright, patent).
<em>Violation of IPR refers to ‘infringement’.</em> Patent law protects the right to use/make/sell/import the invention.</p>
<p>Property is a form of regulation. Property can be of 2 kinds: public and private:</p>
<p>Public property is property which is held in common (also known as ‘the commons’),whereas, private property is owned by an individual.</p>
<p>Real property (land) has physical boundaries &amp; can be distinguished from the
property of another. The owner of land &amp; its boundaries can be
ascertained from the property deed.</p>
<h4 id="meaning-of-intellectual-in-ipr" tabindex="-1">Meaning of ‘intellectual’ in IPR <a class="direct-link" href="#meaning-of-intellectual-in-ipr" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>‘Intellectual’ refers to ‘products that come out of our intellect’</li>
<li>Intellect is our ability to think and understand ideas</li>
<li>An idea is a product of careful thinking</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="common-characteristics-of-ip" tabindex="-1">Common Characteristics of IP <a class="direct-link" href="#common-characteristics-of-ip" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>

<h3 id="the-paris-convention-for-the-protection-of-industrial-property" tabindex="-1">The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property <a class="direct-link" href="#the-paris-convention-for-the-protection-of-industrial-property" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Paris Convention for the protection of Industrial Property adopted in 1883.
The Paris Convention, was revised several times between  1900 and 1979.</p>
<p>The substantive provisions of the Paris Convention fall into  three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>National treatment</li>
<li>Right of priority</li>
<li>Common rules</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the national treatment, each Contracting State must  grant the same protection as its own national to nationals of  other Contracting States or nationals of non-Contracting  States if they are domiciled or have a real and effective  industrial or commercial establishment in a contracting state.</p>
<p>The right of priority means that on basis of a regular first  application filed in one of the Contracting States, the  applicant may, within a certain time apply for protection in  any other Contracting States. These subsequent applications  will be regarded retrospectively from the same day as the  first application.</p>
<p>The common rules for patents granted in different  Contracting States for the same invention are independent:  Patent grants in one Contracting State don’t oblige others to  grant a patent, nor a patent can be refused or terminated for  being refused or terminated in any other Contracting State.</p>
<p>A patent may not be refused because domestic law restricts  or limits sale of patented product, or product obtained  through the patented process.</p>
<p>The inventor has the right to be named as such in the patent.</p>
<h3 id="patent-cooperation-treaty" tabindex="-1">Patent Cooperation Treaty <a class="direct-link" href="#patent-cooperation-treaty" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides patent  protection for an invention simultaneously in large number of  countries by filing an &quot;international&quot; patent application.
The PCT was concluded in 1970, amended in 1979 and  modified in 1984 and in 2001.
It is open to States party to the Paris Convention (1883).
The Treaty regulates in detail the formal requirements with  which international applications must comply.
Filing a PCT application has the effect of automatically  designating all Contracting States bound by the PCT on the  international filing date.</p>
<p>Under PCT, an international application is subjected to an  international search carried out by one of the competent  International Searching Authorities (ISA) under the PCT. A preliminary and non-binding written opinion on the invention meeting the patentability criteria.
Based on the international search report and written opinion, applicant may decide to withdraw or amend amend the claims in the application.
If not withdrawn, the International Bureau, together with the  international search report, publishes it along with the written opinion made available on PATENTSCOPE.</p>
<h3 id="strasbourg-agreement-concerning-the-international-patent-classification" tabindex="-1">Strasbourg Agreement Concerning the International Patent  Classification <a class="direct-link" href="#strasbourg-agreement-concerning-the-international-patent-classification" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>International Patent Classification (IPC) – 8 technology  divisions with approximately 70,000 subdivisions.
IPC Agreement – was concluded in 1971 and amended in  1979 and
It is open to all states party to the Paris Convention (1883).
The appropriate IPC symbols are indicated on patent  documents published by the national or regional industrial  property office.</p>
<h3 id="patent-law-treaty" tabindex="-1">Patent Law Treaty <a class="direct-link" href="#patent-law-treaty" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>The PLT was concluded in 2000, and entered into force in  2005, with the aim of harmonizing and streamlining formal  procedures with respect to national and regional patent  applications, making such procedures more user-friendly.</p>
<p>The PLT is open to States members of WIPO and/or States  party to the Paris Convention certain inter-governmental  organizations. With the significant exception of filing date requirements,  the PLT provides the maximum sets of requirements the  office of a Contracting Party may apply.</p>
<p>Under the PLT, a filing date is accorded upon compliance  with three simple formal requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>an indication that the elements received by the office are  intended to be an application for a patent for an invention</li>
<li>indications that would allow the office to identify or to  contact the applicant</li>
<li>a part which appears to be a description of the invention.</li>
</ul>
<p>A set of formal requirements for national and regional  applications was standardized by incorporating into the PLT  the requirements relating to form or content of international  applications under the PCT.</p>
<p>The standardized Model International Forms that have to be  accepted by the offices of all Contracting Parties were  established.</p>
<p>A number of procedures before patent offices were  simplified, which contributes to a reduction in costs for  applicants as well as for offices.</p>
<p>The PLT provides procedures for avoiding the unintentional  loss of substantive rights resulting from failure to comply  with formality requirements or time limits.</p>
<h3 id="substantive-patent-law-treaty" tabindex="-1">Substantive Patent Law Treaty <a class="direct-link" href="#substantive-patent-law-treaty" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Standing Committee on the Law of Patents (SCP) was  created in 1998 as a forum to discuss issues, facilitate  coordination and provide guidance concerning the  progressive international development of patent law.</p>
<p>The need for patent law harmonization beyond formalities  initiated work on a Substantive Patent Law Treaty (SPLT).</p>
<p>The SCP initially focused on issues directly relevant to  patenting - like, definition of prior art, novelty, inventive  step, industrial applicability, drafting and interpretation of  claims, and sufficient disclosure of the invention.</p>
<p>In Nov. 2000, the SCP, at its 4th session, decided to initiate  work on SPLT.</p>
<p>It’s first draft, including the draft Regulations and Practice  Guidelines was considered in its 5th session in May 2001.</p>
<p>In 6th session in Nov. 2001, the draft provisions were revised, and an approach to establish a seamless interface between the  SPLT, the PLT and PCT was agreed upon.</p>
<p>It also agreed to create a Working Group on Multiple Invention Disclosures and Complex Applications that  includes issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>unity of invention</li>
<li>linking of claims</li>
<li>number of claims</li>
<li>the requirement of &quot;clear and concise&quot; claims and</li>
<li>special procedures to treat complex applications</li>
</ul>
<p>During the subsequent sessions of the SCP the contents of the  draft SPLT were progressively broadened.</p>
<p>At the 10th session, USA, Japan and the European Patent  Office submitted a joint proposal to focus on an initial  package of priority items including definition of prior art,  grace period, novelty and inventive step.</p>
<p>No consensus was reached at the 2005 session in Casablanca, Morocco, and subsequently, the SPLT negotiations were put  on hold in 2006.</p>

<h3 id="indian-pharmaceutical-market" tabindex="-1">Indian Pharmaceutical Market <a class="direct-link" href="#indian-pharmaceutical-market" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>India’s pharmaceutical industry is considered as the 3rd  largest volume wise and 14th in terms of value.
India led a group of 17 high-growth pharmaceuticals  markets also called “pharmerging countries”.
India also stands as “the 2nd leading provider of  medicines distributed by UNICEF in developing world”
India’s pharmaceutical industry was estimated at over  USD $10-billion in 2010
Generic pharma manufacturers dominate the Indian  market, accounting for up to 90% of product sales.</p>
<h3 id="patents-and-pharmaceutical-market" tabindex="-1">Patents &amp; Pharmaceutical Market <a class="direct-link" href="#patents-and-pharmaceutical-market" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>For over 30 years, the Indian government did not allow  product patents for pharmaceutical inventions.
Process patents were recognized as an incentive for  domestic manufacturers to develop cheaper methods of  expensive patented products, keeping the drug prices low.
In 1995, as India joined WTO, it was compelled to revise  its patent laws following a 10-year transition period.  Since 2005, India has been obliged pursuant to the TRIPS  Agreement to integrate patent laws with global standards.
A per TRIPS, the pharmaceutical corporations have the  rights to gain protection for its innovation of medicine.
Jan. 1, 2005 saw “implementation of substantially  enhanced patent protection for pharmaceuticals” in India.
Protests fuelled claiming that the TRIPS is not consistent  with the economic and social conditions of India.
The Indian Government adopted a strategy to interpret its  TRIPS obligations in a manner that still permits the  production of generic medicines, keeping prices as low as  possible to facilitate access to essential medicines.
This brought serious market challenges for the research-  based pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<li>Price gap between the patented  version of Glivec ($5000  monthly dose) and its generic  copy ($200 monthly dose)</li>
<li>In 2006, the Indian Patent Office rejected Novartis’ patent  application for Glivec under Section 3(d) of the Indian  Patents Act under grounds of ‘evergreening’.</li>
<li>Sec. 3(d) make reformulation of pre-existing drug without  improving efficacy ineligible for extended patents.</li>
<li>Indian patent statute or implementing rules do not define  ‘efficacy’ - No guidelines for companies like Novartis  seeking second-generation patents.</li>
<li>Novartis filed 2 legal challenges against Indian govt. – (i)  appealing the rejection of its patent request, (ii) contesting  Sec. 3(d), claiming that it did not comply with TRIPS.</li>
<li>In August 2007, the Madras  High Court ruled against  Novartis’s attempt to overturn  Section 3(d)</li>
<li>In 2009, Intellectual Property  Appellate Board rejected it’s  appeal against the rejection of  its patent application.</li>
<li>Novartis filed a new case in the  Supreme Court, which also  went against it in its April 2013  final verdict.</li>
<li>India argued for rejection of Glivec patent as the modified  version of the drug did not exemplify a significant change  in therapeutic effectiveness over its previous form.</li>
<li>“… the selection of a salt of the active ingredient with the  purpose of improving bioavailability (also referred to as  ‘evergreening’) is well-known in pharmaceutical art”.</li>
<li>India has also argued that under the Doha Declaration on  the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of 2001 its  actions are legal.</li>
<li>The Indian government argue that Sec. 3(d) allows them  the ability to interpret patent laws in favour of national  public health interests.</li>
<li>It represents critical issues  related to IPR  and access to medicines.</li>
<li>It impacted business of pharma  MNCs to conduct business in  India and India’s role as the  “Pharmacy of the Developing  World”.</li>
